# IIsBuilder

Denotes anything that is a builder. What did you expect?

This class was added by a mod with mod-id `contenttweaker`. So you need to have this mod installed if you want to use this feature.

## Importing the class
It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.
```zenscript
mods.contenttweaker.api.IIsBuilder
```

## Methods
### build

Instructs CoT to actually build whatever this builder is supposed to be building.

```zenscript
myIIsBuilder.build(resourceLocation as String);
myIIsBuilder.build("my_awesome_block");
```

| resourceLocation | String | The resource path to give this block |
