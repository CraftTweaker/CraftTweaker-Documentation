# ProjectileLaunchEvent

The ProjectileLaunchEvent is fired whenever an TiCon projectile is lauched.  
It can be canceled.

## Implementing EventClasses
The ProjectileLaunchEvent implements following EventClasses and thus is able to use all functionality they provide as well: 

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`mods.tconstruct.ProjectileLaunchEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
