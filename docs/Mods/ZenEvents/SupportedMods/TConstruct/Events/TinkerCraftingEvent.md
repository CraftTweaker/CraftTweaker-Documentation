# TinkerCraftingEvent

The TinkerCraftingEvent is fired some tinkering was performed.  
Now, since there are many types of toolcrafting, there are multiple Events and thus multiple event handlers as well.

## Implementing EventClasses
The TinkerCraftingEvents all implement the following EventClasses and thus are able to use all functionality they provide as well: 

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as one of these classes:  
```
//Superclass, all TinkerCrafting Events are this class.
mods.tconstruct.TinkerCraftingEvent

//Specific subclasses.
//In most cases you won't need the superclass but only those:
mods.tconstruct.ToolCraftingEvent
mods.tconstruct.ToolModifyEvent
mods.tconstruct.ToolPartReplaceEvent
mods.tconstruct.ToolPartCraftingEvent
```  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## ZenSetter/Getter

Empty table fields mean that the getter/setter does not exist!

| item             |                  | [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack/) (can return null)                  |

## ZenMethod

`event.setCanceled(String localizedName)` Cancels the event and sets the given message as error message for the player.
