# Custom Modifiers

Using this package you can create custom modifiers that you can then put on your tools!

## Importing the class
It might be required for you to import the class if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import mods.tconstruct.modifiers.custom;`

## Creating a modifier

First and foremost, you will need to create a custom modifier.  
This can be done using the static function:
```
//create(String identifier, int color, @Optional int maxLevel, @Optional int countPerLevel)
val myModifier = mods.tconstruct.modifiers.custom.create("kindlich_test", 0xffaadd, 100, 20);
```

For the color, it is suggested that you use the hexadecimal notation as shown above.  
`maxLevel` is the maximum level the modifier can become, and will default to 0.
`countPerLevel` is how many sublevels the modifier can have (like Redstone which has 50).


## Adding modifier items

If you combine the given ingredient together with a tool in a tinker's tool forge, you can apply the modifer.  
```
//myModifier.addModifierItem(IIngredient item, @Optional(1) int amountNeeded, @Optional(1) int amountMatched));
myModifier.addItem(<minecraft:iron_pickaxe>);
myModifier.addItem(<minecraft:iron_block>, 4, 2);
```

- `item` is the item that is matched against. You can use [Item Conditions](/Vanilla/Items/Item_Conditions) but no Transformers or anything else.  
- `amountNeeded` is the amount of items that is matched against. You can split them over all the slots the toolforge provides, which also allows you to go above 64. In the example above, you need 4 iron blocks per addition. Defaults to 1.
- `amountMatched` is the amount of modifier points added per `amountNeeded`. In the example above four iron blocks give two modifier points. Defaults to 1.

## Adding Functionality

First, you can decide if you want to make the modifier hidden, they are shown by default.
```
myModifier.hidden = true;
```

Now that you have created a modifier you need to make it modify something, don't you?  
That's what the modifier event handlers are for:  
They are called whenever a user does something with the tool containing the modifier.

Below you will see all possible handlers, together with information on what they return and how to write the function for them. Remember that you will have to replace `myModifier` with your own variable name.  
Also, you only have to use the handlers that you need, you don't need empty handlers only so that you have filled everything.

Parameters:

- An [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack) representing the used `tool`
- An [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase) representing the `attacker`
- An [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase) representing the `target`

__Returns a bool__ that is `true` if the hit should crit, false whenever else.
