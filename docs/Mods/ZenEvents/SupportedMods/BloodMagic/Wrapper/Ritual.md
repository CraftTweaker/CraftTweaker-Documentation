# Ritual

A ritual is a mystical assembly of blocks and kept running using the lifes of unfortunate souls.  
You are able to retrieve some basic information of these objects that will tell you about their behaviours.

## Importing the class
It might be required for you to import the class if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import mods.bloodmagic.Ritual;`

## Getting such an object
You can get such an object from the [Ritual Events](/Mods/ZenEvents/SupportedMods/BloodMagic/Events/RitualEvent/)

## ZenSetter/Getter

Empty table fields mean that the getter/setter does not exist!
