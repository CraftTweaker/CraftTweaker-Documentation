# ItemBindEvent

The ItemBindEvent is fired whenever Player tries to bind a bindable item.  
It can be canceled, which will result player failing to bind the item.

## Implementing EventClasses
The ItemBindEvent implements following EventClasses and thus is able to use all functionality they provide as well: 

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`mods.bloodmagic.ItemBindEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
