# SacrificialKnifeUsedEvent

The SacrificialKnifeUsedEvent is fired whenever Player tries to use a sacrificial dagger to self-sacrifice near an altar.  
It can be canceled, which will result in the player doing a simple rightclick with the dagger.

## Implementing EventClasses
The SacrificialKnifeUsedEvent implements following EventClasses and thus is able to use all functionality they provide as well: 

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`mods.bloodmagic.SacrificialKnifeUsedEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
