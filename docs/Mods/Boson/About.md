# About Boson

Boson is a library mod at its core, meaning it does not provide any new gameplay features or special mechanics, but
rather acts as the backbone of some other mods, easing the burden and simplifying some repetitive or hard-to-master
tasks during the writing process.

Nevertheless, Boson contains some additional features that may interest the pack maker or a more general user, like
detailed tooltips that can show NBT data or ore dictionary entries. Refer to the functionality list later in this page
to find which of these features are compatible with CraftTweaker.

Moreover, Boson also provides some classes that are part of the (unofficial)
[ZenScriptX Project](/Mods/Boson/ZenScriptX/), which are a set of tools that greatly expand the potential of the
ZenScript language. Refer to the linked page for more information.

Before delving into the features, it is highly suggested to read the [Names in Boson](/Mods/Boson/Names/) page, for
some details in how names are handled in this mod's CraftTweaker interactions.
