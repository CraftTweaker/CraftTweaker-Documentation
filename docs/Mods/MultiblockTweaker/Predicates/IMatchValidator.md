# IMatchValidator

## Importing the Package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.
```zenscript
import mods.gregtech.multiblock.IMatchValidator;
```
## Information
Can be used for matching either a layer, or the whole multiblock.

They are used internally by GregTech for the Distillation Tower, to ensure that each layer contains exactly one fluid output hatch.
