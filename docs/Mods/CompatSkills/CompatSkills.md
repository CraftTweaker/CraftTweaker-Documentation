# Official Compat Addon for Reskillable


## Currently adds Compatibility for:
- Blood Magic
- CraftTweaker
- GameStages
- Immersive Engineering
- Magneticraft


### Important!:
You might notice a lot of references to "String..." in the blank examples.
This is called a VarArg.
It essentially means you can feed it any number of said variable this case "String".

Example:
"reskillable:building|15", "reskillable:magic|7", "stage|test", "adv|minecraft:husbandry/plant_seed"


Currently there is only 1 support not using the VarArg approach which is Requirement Locking through CrT.
This will be switched over in the 1.2.0 release!
