# Requirements:

Requirements is a concept introduced with Reskillable and is essentially Player-Bound properties to bind items behind.

For example by default, Reskillable has Requirement support for the following:
- Advancements
- Skills
- Traits

This list can be further expanded upon by addons.
In-fact CompatSkills adds support for GameStages as a valid Requirement.

The requirement syntax varies from Property to Property on how it's implemented by the addon.
Under [Requirement Types](/Mods/CompatSkills/Requirements/RequirementTypes.md) you'll be able to see the syntax for all Requirements added by Reskillable and CompatSkills.
