# Traits:
Traits is a new addition for Reskillable and makes it so you now can lock things behind a required Trait.
Traits are similar to Skills in the way that we've moved them over to a Resource Location instead of a name to allow for more robust extendability.
The Trait Syntax is as follows:
```
Example:
trait|ResourceLocation

Working Example:
trait|reskillable:battle_spirit
```

You can find the Traits's ResourceLocations under:
[Skills & Traits](/Mods/CompatSkills/Requirements/Skills_Traits/)
