# GameStages

## Special Thanks
Special Thanks goes out to Darkhax for the wonderful changes done in GameStages 2.0.0 !

## Explanation:
So the GameStage Support exists in three form:
- Using GameStages as Requirements
	- To see information about the GameStage Requirement
	- Please visit the Requirement-Type Page:
		- [Link](/Mods/CompatSkills/Requirements/RequirementTypes.md) 	
- Creating "Dummy Traits" that once unlocked, unlocks a GameStage.
- GameStage Locking which cancels the addition of a GameStage if they don't achieve the requirements set for that Stage.
