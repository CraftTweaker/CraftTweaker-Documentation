# CraftTweaker

## PSA:

**PLEASE DO NOTE!**
As of 1.2.0 a lot of changes has been done internally to facilitate more powerful NBT support.
This has come with some changes, one of the notable ones that does affect CrT support is the following!
Config Locks now are "Masters" over CrT Locks, meaning if you have add a non-nbt specific lock to an already established item in the configs.
```
Example:
Config: minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:*=reskillable:mining|16

VS

Crafttweaker: mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement(<minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:*>, "reskillable:mining|4");

Then the lock returned for the item will be:
Mining: 16
```

So if you want to add a non-NBT lock for an item through CrT that already exists in the Configs.
**Please remove the config lock and it will work**


## Requirement Locking:
Currently the main CrT support is for Requirement Locking.
This can also be accomplished through the config system.
However the Config System does **NOT** support NBT!


### Syntax:
```
// Blank Example:
mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement(IItemStack item, String... locked)

Working Examples:

// Adds a lock for the Diamond Pickaxe with a Wildcard Metadata
mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement(<minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:*>, "reskillable:mining|4");

// Adds a NBT Lock for Efficiency 5
mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement(<minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:*>.withTag({ench: [{lvl: 5 as short, id: 32 as short}]}), "reskillable:mining|5", "reskillable:magic|7");

// Adds a NBT Lock for Silk Touch
mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement(<minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:*>.withTag({ench: [{lvl: 1 as short, id: 33 as short}]}), "reskillable:mining|6", "reskillable:agility|7");

// Adds a NBT Lock for Unbreaking 3
mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement(<minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:*>.withTag({ench: [{lvl: 3 as short, id: 34 as short}]}), "reskillable:mining|7", "reskillable:attack|7");
```
