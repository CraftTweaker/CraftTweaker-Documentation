# Aspect Bracket handler

The aspect Bracket Handler allows you to retrieve a Thaumcraft [Aspect Stack](/Mods/Modtweaker/Thaumcraft/Aspects/CTAspectStack) in case you need one.  

Aspects are referenced in the Aspect Bracket handler this way:

```
<aspect:name>

<aspect:ignis>
```

If the Aspect is found, this will return an [CTAspectStack](/Mods/Modtweaker/Thaumcraft/Aspects/CTAspectStack) Object with the stacksize 1.  
Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Mods/Modtweaker/Thaumcraft/Aspects/CTAspectStack) for further information on what you can do with these.
