# Trait Bracket Handler

The Trait Bracket handler's sole purpose is providing you with [Trait Representations](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Trait).

You use the trait bracket handler like this:

```
<ticontrait:identifier>

<ticontrait:cactus>
```

If the Trait is found, this will return an Trait Representation Object.
Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Trait) for further information on what you can do with these.
