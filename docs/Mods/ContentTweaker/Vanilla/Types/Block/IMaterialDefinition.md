# IMaterialDefinition

An IMaterialDefinition object represents a material definition in the game. A Material Definition is needed if you want to create a new block.

## Importing the package
Currently this class is not a ZenClass, so there is no way for you to import anything!


## Calling an IMaterialDefinition object
You can get such an object using the [Block Material Bracket Handler](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Brackets/Bracket_Block_Material/):  
`<blockmaterial:wood>`
