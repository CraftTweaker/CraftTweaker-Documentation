# Creative Tab Bracket Handler

The Creative Tab Bracket Handler gives you access to the Creative Tabs in the game.  


Creative Tabs are referenced in the creative tabs handler this way:

Vanilla
```
<creativetab:name>

<creativetab:misc>
```

If the creative tab is found, this will return a [creative tab](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Creatable_Content/Creative_tab/) Object.
