# Syntax

## Avoiding Script Errors
- Every function in your script has to end with a semicolon (`;`). You will see this inside examples and you will get used to doing it very quickly.
- Use proper brackets.
  - Remember to close your brackets. Most text editors come with either a bracket pair highlighting or automatically creating a closing bracket.

## Referencing
- Every reference to an item in game **must** be referenced with `<>`.
  - `<item:modID:itemID>`
