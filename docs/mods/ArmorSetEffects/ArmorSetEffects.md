#SetEffects

1.16 port of SetEffects, a mod that gives some customisable effects to the entities that are wearing certain, crafttweaker customisable, armor sets.

Includes most methods from the original mod: https://github.com/Lemonszz/SetEffect/

Package: `import mods.seteffect.ArmorSetEffect`

`new ArmorSetEffect(String name) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Creates a new ArmorSetEffect with the specified name. Standard name rules apply `[a-z0-9/._-]`.

`ArmorSetEffect.dumpParticleNames() as void` -> Prints a list of particle names to the crafttweaker.log file.

#Instance Methods: 

`MyArmorSetEffect.inSlot(slot as MCEquipmentSlotType, item as IItemStack) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Checks for a certain [IItemStack](/vanilla/api/items/IItemStack) in the specified [slot](/vanilla/api/util/MCEquipmentSlotType).

`MyArmorSetEffect.setIgnoreNBT() as ArmorSetEffect` -> Ignores NBT data for the specified Items in the ArmorSetEffect.

`MyArmorSetEffect.requireGamestages(stages as string[]) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Adds the specified GameStages to the required GameStages list. Requires GameStagesAPI to be installed.

`MyArmorSetEffect.setPackmode(packmode as string) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Makes the effect only happen in a certain packmode.

`MyArmorSetEffect.addParticleWithDefaultSpread(particleName as string) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Adds a non customisable particle spread with the specified particle.

`MyArmorSetEffect.addImmunity(effect as MCPotionEffect) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Makes the player wearing the set immune to that [effect](/vanilla/api/potions/MCPotionEffect).

`MyArmorSetEffect.addEffect(effect as MCPotionEffectInstance) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Makes the player wearing the set receive that [effect](/vanilla/api/potions/MCPotionEffectInstance).

`MyArmorSetEffect.addAttributeEffect(attribute as Attribute, modifier as AttributeModifier) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Adds the [attribute](/vanilla/api/entity/Attribute) and it's [modifier](/vanilla/api/entity/AttributeModifier) to all armor pieces when worn.

`MyArmorSetEffect.addAttackerEffect(effect as MCPotionEffectInstance) as ArmorSetEffect` -> Makes the entity that attacks the player wearing this set receive an [effect](/vanilla/api/potions/MCPotionEffectInstance).

`MyArmorSetEffect.register() as void  ` -> Registers our ArmorSetEffect.



#Example Set:
```zenscript
import mods.SetEffect.ArmorSetEffect;

ArmorSetEffect.dumpParticleNames(); 
//Can be commented out after getting the right name for what you want.

val iron_set = new ArmorSetEffect("iron_set")
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:head>, <item:minecraft:iron_helmet>)
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:chest>, <item:minecraft:iron_chestplate>)
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:legs>, <item:minecraft:iron_leggings>)
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:feet>, <item:minecraft:iron_boots>)
               .setIgnoreNBT()
               .addEffect(<effect:minecraft:regeneration>.newInstance(100, 5))
               .addImmunity(<effect:minecraft:blindness>)
               .addAttackerEffect(<effect:minecraft:poison>.newInstance(60, 1))
               .requireGamestages("hello");
iron_set.register();

//You can also chain the register to remove the need for a variable.

 new ArmorSetEffect("iron_set")
                .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:head>, <item:minecraft:iron_helmet>)
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:chest>, <item:minecraft:iron_chestplate>)
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:legs>, <item:minecraft:iron_leggings>)
               .inSlot(<equipmentslottype:feet>, <item:minecraft:iron_boots>)
               .addEffect(<effect:minecraft:regeneration>.newInstance(10, 5))
               .addParticle("minecraft:angry_villager",  1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, -5.0f, -5.0f, -5.0f, 2.0f, 0.3f, 2);
               .register();
