# PlayerDeathDrops

The PlayerDeathDrops Event is fired whenever a player's items fall to the ground due to his/her death.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerDeathDropsEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import) the class before and use that name then.
