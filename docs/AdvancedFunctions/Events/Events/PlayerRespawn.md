# PlayerRespawn

The PlayerRespawn Event is fired whenever a player respawns.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerRespawnEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import) the class before and use that name then.

The following information can be retrieved from the event:

| ZenGetter | Return Type                         |
