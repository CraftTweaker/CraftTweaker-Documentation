# Software
You can use any text editor that you prefer, however it is generally advised to ***not*** use Windows Notepad.

Here are some great ones that should be perfect for general scripting  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)  
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows only)

## Plugins
Plugins aren't required to write scripts, but they do help by adding small niceties such as Syntax Highlighting.
