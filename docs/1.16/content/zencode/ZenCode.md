# About ZenCode

This is the documentation section that talks about ZenCode, the programming language that CraftTweaker employs to read and interpret scripts.
This section aims to appeal to the more experienced coder that aims to dive into the more complex side of the language in order to approach parts of the mod such as Loot Modifiers, Events, ZenClasses or Functions.

This is not to say that the novice scripter has no place here, but keep in mind that the usages of features in this section go further than adding and removing recipes.

Currently documented features:
    -[Arrays And Lists](/zencode/ArraysAndLists)
    -[Preprocessors](/zencode/Preprocessors/Preprocessors)

Other concepts:

    -[Conditional Code](/zencode/ConditionalCode)
