# Preprocessors

Preprocessors are, as their name suggests, a list of markers a script can have applied to it that tag the script with information when it is compiled.
They run various actions on scripts. A preprocessor is called by placing `#preprocessorname [arguments]` somewhere in your script, it depends on the preprocessor itself. Be careful not to accidentally enable one through the use of a comment!
