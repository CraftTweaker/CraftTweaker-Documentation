# Future Of Minetweaker
My activity on MineTweaker (and Minecraft) has decreased a lot recently. A lot of features were being proposed but many of these may not make it in a future release. Nonetheless, I want to make sure that MineTweaker can be used in the foreseeable future, and I wanted to publish a statement about what I will (and won't) do.

## Contents
* An update to the scripting language is underway
* MineTweaker will be updated to Minecraft 1.8
* MineTweaker 3.1 will not be what is planned.
* All mod support will be moved to addons

### An update to the scripting language is underway
This update is taking me forever, but I _will_ release it. Once this new version is out (it will be 3.0.10), the full scripting language and all the functions available in it will be clearly documented. The MineTweaker API will get an update too. This update will include new scripting functions, such as event handlers, allowing you to react to players logging in, blocks being broken, things being crafted and so on.

### MineTweaker will be updated to Minecraft 1.8
This will be done as soon as the scripting update is finished. This shouldn't take much time.

### MineTweaker 3.1 will not be what is planned.
Some of the more basic features will be added to MineTweaker, whilst creation of custom blocks might not be possible. I had a system in mind to transfer resources from server to client, making it possible to distribute simple mods easily by programming them in MineTweaker, but I don't think I will have enough time for that.

### All mod support will be moved to addons
It is a lot of work to keep them maintained, and haven't for a long time. ALL MOD SUPPORT CODE IS NOW MIT - feel free to copy it into your own mod support addons. Also, any addons can freely use the forums for support and the wiki for documentation. If you wish, you can have your own section of the MineTweaker forums.
