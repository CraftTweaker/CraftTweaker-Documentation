# MineTweaker 3.1
The goal of MineTweaker 3.1 is to expand beyond simple modifications and turn ZenScript into a complete programming language and its functionality into a full modding API. Besides simple scripts, scripts and assets can be bundled into mod packages (zip files), stored on a server and then synchronized with clients that connect to it.

With MineTweaker 3.1, the goal is to develop a simply yet powerful API allowing people with minimal programming skills to develop their own mods - with better programmers being able to create more complex mods while anyone has the ability to perform simple modifications.

MineTweaker 3.1 consists of multiple aspects:

* The API, which is accessible from ZenScript
* The completed version of the ZenScript language
* A file synchronization system to make clients automatically copy the configuration and MineTweaker mods from the server they connect with

This documentation is currently available (preliminary, subject to change):
