# Script Introduction
MineTweaker is built on top of a custom-built scripting language, called ZenScript.

The goal of the custom scripting language is to offer a simple language that can be used by inexperienced programmers for simple tasks as well as experienced programmers for advanced tasks. In MineTweaker context, this means you can do simple modifications by just following tutorials and more advanced scripting if delve more deep into the matter. Although there is currently little capability for advanced scripting, future additions will make it possible to do far more advanced scripting tasks than are available now.
