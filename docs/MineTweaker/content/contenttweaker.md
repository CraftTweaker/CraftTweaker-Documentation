ContentTweaker is an addon for MineTweaker 3. Minetweaker lets you adjust recipes, remove them entirely, or add new recipes. One of the features that it lacks, is the ability to create new Items and Blocks, ContentTweaker plans on allowing users to add more to their game, not only recipes, but actual Items and Blocks.
