# IEntityXp

Represents an XP Orb in the world.  

## Importing the package
It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import crafttweaker.entity.IEntityXp;`

## Extending [IEntity](IEntity)
IEntityXp extends [IEntity](IEntity). That means all functions available to [IEntities](IEntity) also are available to IEntityXp.
