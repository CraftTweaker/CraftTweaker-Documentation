# Creative Tab Bracket Handler

The Creative Tab Bracket Handler gives you access to the creative Tabs in the game. 

They are referenced in the Creative Tab handler this way:

```
<creativetab:name>

<creativetab:misc>
```

If the Creative Tab is found, this will return an ICreativeTab Object.
Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Vanilla/CreativeTabs/ICreativeTab/) for further information on what you can do with these.
