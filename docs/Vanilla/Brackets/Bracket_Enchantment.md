# Enchantment Bracket Handler

The Enchantment Bracket Handler gives you access to the Enchantment definitions in the game. 

They are referenced in the Enchantment handler this way:

```
<enchantment:modid:name>

<enchantment:minecraft:protection>
```

If the Enchantment is found, this will return an IEnchantmentDefinition Object.
Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Vanilla/Enchantments/IEnchantmentDefinition/) for further information on what you can do with these.
