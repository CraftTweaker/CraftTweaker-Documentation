# BlockPlaceEvent

The BlockBreak Event is fired whenever a block is being placed.
You can cancel the event to prevent the block from being placed.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.BlockPlaceEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
BlockPlace Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [IBlockEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IBlockEvent/)


## ZenGetters
The following information can be retrieved from the event:
