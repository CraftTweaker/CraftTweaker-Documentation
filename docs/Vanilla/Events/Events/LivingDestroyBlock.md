# LivingDestroyBlock 

This event is fired whenever a Wither or Ender Dragon attempts to destroy blocks, or when a zombie attempts to break a door. This event is **cancelable**, and if canceled, the block will not be broken.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.LivingDestroyBlockEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
