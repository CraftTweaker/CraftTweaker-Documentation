# PlayerLoggedOut

The PlayerLoggedOut Event is fired whenever a player logs out.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerLoggedOutEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import) the class before and use that name then.

| ZenGetter | Return Type                         |
