# PlayerFillBucket

The PlayerFillBucket Event is fired whenever a player fills a bucket.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerFillBucketEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import) the class before and use that name then.


## Event interface extensions
PlayerFillBucket Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](IEventCancelable)
- [IPlayerEvent](IPlayerEvent)
- [IProcessableEvent](IProcessableEvent)
- [IEventPositionable](IEventPositionable)

## ZenGetters
The following information can be retrieved from the event:
