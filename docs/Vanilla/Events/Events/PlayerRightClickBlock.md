# PlayerRightClickBlock

The PlayerRightClickBlock Event is fired whenever a player right clicks a block.  
It can be canceled to prevent any other events from taking place.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerRightClickBlockEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
PlayerRightClickBlock Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](IEventCancelable)
- [PlayerInteract](PlayerInteract)
- [IPlayerEvent](IPlayerEvent)


## ZenGetters
The following information can be retrieved from the event:

| ZenGetter   | ZenGetter  |  Type                                 |
|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `hitVector` |            | [IVector3d](/Vanilla/World/IVector3d) |
| `useBlock`  | `useBlock` | string ("ALLOW" / "DENY" / "DEFAULT") |
| `useItem`   | `useItem`  | string ("ALLOW" / "DENY" / "DEFAULT") |

## ZenMethods

- `event.cancel()` sets the event as cancelled.
