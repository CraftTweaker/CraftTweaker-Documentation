# ArrowLoose

This event is fired when a player stops using a bow.
## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:

You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

ArrowLoose Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
