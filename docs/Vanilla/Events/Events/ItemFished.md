# ItemFishedEvent

This event is fired to when a player is about to fish up an item. Cancelling the event will prevent the player from receiving an item, but the rod will still take damage.

## Notes

Additional damage can be done to the rod by setting `event.additionalDamage`. A list of IItemStacks (which is **not modifiable**) that are going to be fished up is contained within `event.drops`.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.ItemFishedEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
ItemFished Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)


## ZenGetters/ZenSetters
The following information can be retrieved/set during the event:
