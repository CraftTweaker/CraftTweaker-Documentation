# Seeds
Seeds are things you get from punching tall grass.

## Print all seeds to the log

This command will print all registered seeds to the log.

Needs to be performed by a player or console, cannot be written in a zs-file.
```
1.12
/ct seeds

pre-1.12
/mt seeds
```

## Add a seed drop

Adds `item` as seed drop.  
**Weights are relative to grass seed, which has a weight of 10 (â‰™ 1000%)!**

```
vanilla.seeds.addSeed(item);
```

`item` is a [weightedItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/WeightedItemStack/).
What does that mean? It simply means that you need to give it a percentage like this:

```
//adds carrots with a weight of 1
vanilla.seeds.addSeed(<minecraft:carrot> % 100);
```


## Remove a seed drop

Stops `item` from being a seed drop.
```
vanilla.seeds.removeSeed(item);
```
`item` is an [IIngredient](/Vanilla/Variable_Types/IIngredient/).



## Retrieve all registered Seeds

Returns all items as a [weightedItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/WeightedItemStack/) List.
```
val seedList = vanilla.seeds.seeds;

for item in seedList {
	print("Item: " ~ item.stack.displayName ~ " || Chance: " ~ item.percent ~ "%");
}
```
