# IFacing

The IFacing Interface allows you to get an [IBlockPos's](/Vanilla/World/IBlockPos/) possible directions.

## Importing the package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues, so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import crafttweaker.world.IFacing;`

## Enumerations

The Facing interface has 6 static methods that return the said direction.  
It also has one more that takes the direction as String input (e.g. `"NORTH"`)

```zenscript
crafttweaker.world.IFacing.north()
crafttweaker.world.IFacing.east()
crafttweaker.world.IFacing.south()
crafttweaker.world.IFacing.west()
crafttweaker.world.IFacing.down()
crafttweaker.world.IFacing.up()


crafttweaker.world.IFacing.fromString(String name);
```

## ZenGetters/ZenMethods without parameters

| ZenGetter  | ZenMethod  | Return Type |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| name       | getName()  | string      |
| rotateY    | rotateY()  | IFacing     |
| opposite   | opposite() | IFacing     |

## Other methods

### Comparing two Facings

You can compare two facings using the standart comparing Operators `== != < > <= >=`  
Alternatively, you can use the function, though the function returns an int that is 0 if they are equal.

```zenscript
//Returns true or false
facingOne == facingTwo;

//Returns 0 if they are equal
facingOne.compare(facingTwo);
```

### Getting from Entities

`IFacing.DirectionFromEntityLiving(IBlockPos pos, IEntityLivingBase placer);`

The static method returns an IFacing from [IEntityLivingBase](Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase). The method is often used to determine the facing of some blocks when placed by players, like piston, observer, command block, etc. Unlike the `horizontalFacing` getter of `IEntity`, the method can return `UP` and `DOWN`. And it always returns the opposite value of the getter.
