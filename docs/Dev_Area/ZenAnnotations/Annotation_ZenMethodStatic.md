# ZenMethodStatic

The `@ZenMethodStatic` annotations can only be used in [ZenExpansions](/Dev_Area/ZenAnnotations/Annotation_ZenExpansion/).  
It exposes a static method that, unlike [ZenMethods](/Dev_Area/ZenAnnotations/Annotation_ZenMethod/) in Expansions, dont need an instance as first parameter, since they are static.
