# Examples

You can use the `/ct examples` command to get some commented scripts in your scripts/examples  directory

More script examples can be found here:

Keep in mind that examples are, after all, scripts, and that the next time you reload the game, they will be loaded. Examples may include undesired changes or functionality, so be careful with that.
