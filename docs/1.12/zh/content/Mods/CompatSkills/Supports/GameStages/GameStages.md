# GameStage（游戏阶段）:

## 特别鸣谢

特别感谢Darkhax在GameStage 2.0.0方面所做的卓越改变！

## Explanation:

- So the GameStage Support exists in three form:
- Using GameStages as requirements 
    - To see information about the GameStage requirement
    - Please visit the Requirement-Type Page: 
        - [Link](/Mods/CompatSkills/Requirements/Requirements/) 
- Creating "Dummy Traits" that once unlocked, unlock a GameStage.
- GameStage Locking which cancels the addition of a GameStage if the player's don't have the requirements set for that stage.
