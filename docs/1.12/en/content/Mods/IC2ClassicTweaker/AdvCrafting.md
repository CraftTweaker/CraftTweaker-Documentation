# Advanced Recipes

## Package

```zenscript
import mods.ic2.AdvRecipes;
```

## Recipe Types
There are several types of recipes:

### Shaped Recipes
Shaped Recipes are recipes, where it matters, which item goes into which slot.
For example, you can't just arrange 7 different sized stacks of iron ingots in any order to create iron leggings. The shape matters, thus it is a shaped recipe.

### Shapeless Recipes
Shapeless Recipes are recipes, where only the items you put in the crafting grid matter, whereas the shape is of no importance.
For example, blue and yellow dye create green dye. This recipe doesn't care about where you put which item.

## Add Recipes

### addShaped
```zenscript
mods.ic2.AdvRecipes.addShaped(output,inputs);
```

This creates a shaped recipe for `output` using `inputs` as Ingredients.

`output` is an [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack/)  
`inputs` is an [IIngredient](/Vanilla/Variable_Types/IIngredient/)[][] (see below)

`inputs` is a 2 Dimensional [IIngredient](/Vanilla/Variable_Types/IIngredient/) Array.  
So the recipe for Iron Leggings would be written as `[[iron,iron,iron],[iron,null,iron],[iron,null,iron]]`  
If that looks to confusing, try splitting the arrays up into one array per line
```zenscript
val iron = <minecraft:iron_ingot>;
val leggings = <minecraft:iron_leggings>;

AdvRecipes.addShaped(leggings,
 [[iron * 5,iron * 7,iron * 5],
  [iron * 3,null,iron * 3],
  [iron,null,iron]]);
```

### addShapeless
```zenscript
mods.ic2.AdvRecipes.addShapeless(output,inputs)
```

This creates a shapeless stacked recipe for `output` using `inputs` as Ingredients.

`output` is an [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack/)  
`inputs` is an [IIngredient](/Vanilla/Variable_Types/IIngredient/)[]  (e.g. [<minecraft:dye:1>,<minecraft:dye:2>])

### addHidden
```zenscript
mods.ic2.AdvRecipes.addHiddenShapeless(IItemStack output, IIngredient[] ingredients);
mods.ic2.AdvRecipes.addHiddenShaped(IItemStack output, IIngredient[][] ingredients);
```

This creates a shaped or shapeless stacked recipe for `output` using `inputs` as Ingredients that is hidden.
