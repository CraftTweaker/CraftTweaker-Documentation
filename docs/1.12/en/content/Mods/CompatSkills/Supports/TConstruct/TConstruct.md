# Tinker's Construct

## Notice
As of CompatSkills 1.9.0, TConstruct Locks now pass "up" to item-level.
That way the tools are still inaccessible if a friend provides a crafted version.


## Commands
```
// Dumps all Materials
~ /ct tinkermaterials

// Dumps all Modifiers
~ /ct tinkermodifiers
```


## Tool-Creation Locks
By adding a normal ItemStack lock to any of the Tinker Tool-Types (not Part-Types!).
You can lock the creation of a Tinker Tool-Type!
