# Mill


## Basic Recipe

* Adds a Mill Recipe  
```zenscript
mods.betterwithmods.Mill.addRecipe(IIngredient[] inputs, IItemStack[] outputs);
//Examples
mods.betterwithmods.Mill.addRecipe([<minecraft:dirt>],[<minecraft:stone>]);
```

## Removal

* Remove a Mill recipe based on the output
```zenscript
mods.betterwithmods.Mill.remove(IItemStack[] outputs);
```

* Remove all Mill recipes
```zenscript
mods.betterwithmods.Mill.removeAll();
```


## Builder 

The Mill has a recipe builder that allows more precise control over the recipes.
All previous methods are simply short cuts to using the builder.

* To create a new Mill builder.
`mods.betterwithmods.Mill.builder()`

* Mill builder methods
     * Sets up the inputs and outputs of the recipe    
       ```zenscript
       buildRecipe(IIngredient[] inputs, IItemStack[] outputs)
       ```
     * Sets the priority of the recipe, the lower the priority the sooner it will be crafted. Default=0.    
       ```zenscript
       setPriority(int priority)
       ```
     * Set the sound of a Mill Recipe.   
       ```zenscript
       setSound(String soundLocation)
       ```
     * Finalize the recipe and add it to the game    
       ```zenscript
       build()
       ```

### Example builder usage
```zenscript
mods.betterwithmods.Mill.builder()
.buildRecipe([<minecraft:stone>], [<minecraft:stone>])
.setGrindType("minecraft:entity.ghast.scream")
.build();
```
