# ProjectileImpactFireball

This event is fired whenever a fireball impacts an entity but before damage, etc, is calculated. It is **cancelable**, and if canceled, the impact will not be processed.

Acceleration values from the fireball entity are available through zengetters.

## Importing the class
It might be required to [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class to avoid errors.  
`import crafttweaker.event.ProjectileImpactFireballEvent;`

## Extending IEntityEvent
ProjectileImpactFireball Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IProjectileEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IProjectileEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)

## ZenGetters and ZenSetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:
