# PlayerRightClickItem

The PlayerRightClickItem Event is fired shortly before an item's functionality is fired. It is not fired if the player is targetting a block or entity.
It can be canceled to prevent any other events from taking place.
If the event is canceled, a specific result of allow, deny, or pass can be provided. By default, the result is pass.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerRightClickItemEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
PlayerRightClickItem Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [PlayerInteract](/Vanilla/Events/Events/PlayerInteract/)

## ZenGetters & ZenSetters
The following information can be adjusted in the event.

| ZenGetter            | ZenSetter            | type                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `cancellationResult` | `cancellationResult` | string ("allow" / "deny" / "default") |
