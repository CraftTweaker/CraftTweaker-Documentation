# PlayerAdvancement

The PlayerAdvancement Event is fired whenever a player is awarded an Advancement.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerAdvancementEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerAdvancement Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
