# PlayerInteractEntity

The PlayerInteractEntity Event is fired whenever a player interacts with an Entity.
It can be canceled to prevent the interaction from taking place.
If the event is canceled, a specific result of success, fail or pass can be provided. By default, the result is pass.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerInteractEntityEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
PlayerInteractEntity Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [PlayerInteract](/Vanilla/Events/Events/PlayerInteract/)
