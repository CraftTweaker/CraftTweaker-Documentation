# PortalSpawn

The PortalSpawn Event is fired when an attempt is made to spawn a nether portal. If cancelled, the portal will not be spawned.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PortalSpawnEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

BlockNeighborNotify Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [IBlockEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IBlockEvent/)



## ZenGetters/ZenSetters
The following information can be retrieved from the event:

| ZenGetter       | ZenSetter       | Type                                              |

## Notes
`valid` will return true if the portal is valid to be spawned, false if it cant spawn the portal like this.
