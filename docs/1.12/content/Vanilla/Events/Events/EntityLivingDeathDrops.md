# EntityLivingDeathDrops

The EntityLivingDeathDrops Event is fired whenver an Entity's death causes dropped items to appear.  
It can be canceled to stop the entity from dropping anything.

## Event Class

`crafttweaker.event.EntityLivingDeathDropsEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
PlayerDeathDrops Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [ILivingEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ILivingEvent/)

ZenMethods
- `event.cancel();` Method, returns void (nothing). Can cancel the event and stop something from happening

## Modifying the item drops

You can either add to the droplist or completely substitute it with a new one:
```zenscript
event.drops = //reference to IEntityItem list.

//event.addItem(IItemStack item);
event.addItem(<minecraft:iron_ingot>);

//event.addItem(IEntityItem iten);
event.addItem(<minecraft:iron_ingot>.createEntityItem(event.player.world, event.player.position));
```
