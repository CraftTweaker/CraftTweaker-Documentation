# PlayerClone

Fired when the EntityPlayer is cloned, typically caused by the network sending a RESPAWN_PLAYER event. Either caused by death, or by traveling from the End to the overworld.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerCloneEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
PlayerRespawn Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)


## ZenGetters/ZenSetters
The following information can be retrieved from the event:
| ZenGetter       | ZenSetter       | Type                                              |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `originalPlayer`|                 | [IPlayer](/Vanilla/Players/IPlayer/)              |
| `wasDeath`      |                 | bool                                              |

## Notes
`wasDeath` will be true, if the reason for cloning is player death. Could be false, e.g. on dimension travel


## ZenGetters/ZenSetters/ZenMethods from extensions
The following information can be retrieved from the event:
| ZenGetter       | ZenSetter       | Type                                              |
