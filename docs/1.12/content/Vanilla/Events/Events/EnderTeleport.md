# EnderTeleport

The EnderTeleport event is fired whenever an enderman or shulker teleport.  
It is also fired whenever a player teleports using an enderpearl (it is possible that other mods fire this event as well.)

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.EnderTeleportEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
LivingEntityUseItem Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [ILivingEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ILivingEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
