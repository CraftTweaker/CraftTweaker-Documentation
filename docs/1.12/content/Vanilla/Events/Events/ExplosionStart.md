# ExplosionStart

The ExplosionStart Event is fired shortly before an explosion starts. If canceled, the explosion will not happen.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.ExplosionStartEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
ExplosionStart Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IExplosionEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IExplosionEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)


## ZenGetters/ZenSetters/ZenMethods from extensions
The following information can be retrieved from the event:
