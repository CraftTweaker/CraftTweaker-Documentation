# GameStages

## Special Thanks
Special Thanks goes out to Darkhax for the wonderful changes done in GameStages 2.0.0 !

## Explanation:
- So the GameStage Support exists in three form:
- Using GameStages as requirements
	- To see information about the GameStage requirement
	- Please visit the Requirement-Type Page:
		- [Link](/Mods/CompatSkills/Requirements/Requirements/) 	
- Creating "Dummy Traits" that once unlocked, unlock a GameStage.
- GameStage Locking which cancels the addition of a GameStage if the player's don't have the requirements set for that stage.
