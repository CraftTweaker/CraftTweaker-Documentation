# PlayerTick

The PlayerTick Event is fired each tick for each player on both client and server.

## Event-Klasse

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerTickEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Erweiterte Event-Schnittellen

PlayerTick Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [ITickEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ITickEvent/)

## ZenGetter

There is no additional information provided that is not already in the interfaces above.
