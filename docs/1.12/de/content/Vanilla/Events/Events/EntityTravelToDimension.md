The EntityTravelToDimension event is fired whenever an entity is about to travel to another dimension. If canceled, the entity is prevented from travel.

## Notes

`event.dimension` contains the dimension the entity is about to travel to.

## Event-Klasse
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.EntityTravelToDimensionEvent` You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
