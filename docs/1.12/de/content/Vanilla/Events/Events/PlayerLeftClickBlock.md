# PlayerLeftClickBlock

The PlayerLeftClickBlock Event is fired whenever a player left clicks a block.  
It can be canceled to prevent any other events from taking place. If the player holds down the left click, the event will fire again even if it has been canceled. Canceling this event will prevent the left click from being registered, preventing block breaking (although not in creative mode). If the event is canceled, a specific result of success, fail or pass can be provided. By default, the result is pass.

## Event-Klasse
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerLeftClickBlockEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
