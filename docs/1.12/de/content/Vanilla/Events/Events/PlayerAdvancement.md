# PlayerAdvancement

The PlayerAdvancement Event is fired whenever a player is awarded an Advancement.

## Event-Klasse

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerAdvancementEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Erweiterte Event-Schnittellen

PlayerAdvancement Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)

## ZenGetter

Die folgenden Informationen lassen sich von diesem Event (Ereignis) abrufen:

| ZenGetter | RÃ¼ckgabetyp |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `id`      | string      |

## Id

Apart from the functionality the PlayerEvent exposes you can get the advancement's ID as string.

This can for example be a string like

```zenscript
"minecraft:story/mine_diamond"
```
