# ClientTick

The ClientTick Event is fired every tick on the client.

## Класс события
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.ClientTickEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Наследование от интерфейсов событий
WorldTick Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [ITickEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ITickEvent/)

## ZenGetters
There is no additional information besides the information mentioned in the interfaces above.
