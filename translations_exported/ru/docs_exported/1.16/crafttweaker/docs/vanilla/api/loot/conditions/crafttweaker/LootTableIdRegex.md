# LootTableIdRegex

Builder for a 'LootTableIdRegex' loot condition.

 This condition will pass if and only if the ID of the loot table currently being queried matches the target regex.

 While this condition is provided merely as a convenience, it is suggested not to rely on this condition only. Due to backwards compatibility, some loot tables may in fact lack an ID or have overlapping ones. Other conditions should be used instead.

 The 'LootTableIdRegex' condition requires a regex to be built.
