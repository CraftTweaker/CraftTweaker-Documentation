# ITargetingStrategy

Represents a way of targeting components for replacement.

 A targeting strategy is thus responsible for determining how [IRecipeComponent](/vanilla/api/recipe/IRecipeComponent)&lt;T&gt;s are treated when dealing with replacement. For example, a strategy might determine that all composite components should be decomposed into atoms.

 For script writers, a strategy can be obtained with the `<targetingstrategy>` bracket handler.

 For integration writers, an instance of a targeting strategy can be obtained through the `find` method. Any newly created strategy must be registered in the CraftTweaker plugin to be available to users.

 This is a FunctionalInterface whose functional method is [this](.)#castStrategy(IRecipeComponent, Object, Function).

## Импорт класса

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.recipe.replacement.ITargetingStrategy;
```
