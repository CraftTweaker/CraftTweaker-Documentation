# DistancePredicate

Represents a predicate for distance.

 The predicate can effectively be used to check the distance between two coordinates in 3D-space. The distance will firstly be checked separately against the x, y, and z bounds that have been specified. If those checks succeed, then horizontal distance will be taken into consideration, measuring the distance between the two points only along the X and Z axis. Lastly, the absolute distance considering all axis will be checked.

 Any of the above checks will be skipped if no value has been specified for any of them. By default, the predicate will not add any restrictions on the distance between two points.

## Импорт класса

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.DistancePredicate;
```


## Extending AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate

DistancePredicate extends [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate). That means all methods available in [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate) are also available in DistancePredicate

## Methods

### withMaximumAbsoluteDistance

Sets the maximum value the absolute distance should be to <code>max</code>.

 If the absolute distance had already some bounds specified, then the maximum value of the bound will be overwritten with the value specified in <code>max</code>. On the other hand, if the absolute distance didn't have any bounds set, the maximum is set, leaving the lower end unbounded.

 The maximum value is inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to <code>max</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [DistancePredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/DistancePredicate)

```zenscript
DistancePredicate.withMaximumAbsoluteDistance(max as float) as DistancePredicate
```

### withMaximumHorizontalDistance

Sets the maximum value the horizontal distance should be to <code>max</code>.

 If the horizontal distance had already some bounds specified, then the maximum value of the bound will be overwritten with the value specified in <code>max</code>. On the other hand, if the horizontal distance didn't have any bounds set, the maximum is set, leaving the lower end unbounded.

 The maximum value is inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to <code>max</code> will pass the check.
