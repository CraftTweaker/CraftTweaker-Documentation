# EffectData

Holds the data an [MCPotionEffect](/vanilla/api/potions/MCPotionEffect) should have to pass a parent predicate check.

 This predicate can check various properties of the effect, such as its duration or amplifier value. It is also able to verify whether the effect has been applied by the ambient or by a potion and whether the effect has visible particles or not.

 By default, no restrictions are placed on the effect's data.

## Импорт класса

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.EffectData;
```


## Extending AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate

EffectData extends [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate). That means all methods available in [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate) are also available in EffectData

## Methods

### withAmbient

Indicates that the effect must be environmental.

 An example of such effect is the one applied by a beacon.

 If the predicate had already been set to check the opposite condition, the setting will be overwritten.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withAmbient() as EffectData
myEffectData.withAmbient();
```

### withBoundedAmplifier

Sets both the minimum and maximum value the amplifier should be to <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
 respectively.

 If the amplifier had already some bounds specified, then they will be overwritten with the new values.

 Both minimum and maximum values are inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to either <code>min</code> or
 <code>max</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withBoundedAmplifier(min as int, max as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                                |
| -------- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| min      | int | The minimum value the amplifier should be. |
| max      | int | The maximum value the amplifier should be. |


### withBoundedDuration

Sets both the minimum and maximum value the duration should be to <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
 respectively.

 If the duration had already some bounds specified, then they will be overwritten with the new values.

 Both minimum and maximum values are inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to either <code>min</code> or
 <code>max</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withBoundedDuration(min as int, max as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                               |
| -------- | --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| min      | int | The minimum value the duration should be. |
| max      | int | The maximum value the duration should be. |


### withExactAmplifier

Sets the amplifier to exactly match the given <code>value</code>.

 If the amplifier had already some bounds specified, then they will be overwritten with the new value.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withExactAmplifier(value as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                              |
| -------- | --- | ---------------------------------------- |
| value    | int | The exact value the amplifier should be. |


### withExactDuration

Sets the duration to exactly match the given <code>value</code>.

 If the duration had already some bounds specified, then they will be overwritten with the new value.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withExactDuration(value as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                             |
| -------- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| value    | int | The exact value the duration should be. |


### withInvisibility

Indicates that the effect's particles must be invisible.

 If the predicate had already been set to check the opposite condition, the setting will be overwritten.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withInvisibility() as EffectData
myEffectData.withInvisibility();
```

### withMaximumAmplifier

Sets the maximum value the amplifier should be to <code>max</code>.

 If the amplifier had already some bounds specified, then the maximum value of the bound will be overwritten with the value specified in <code>max</code>. On the other hand, if the amplifier didn't have any bounds set, the maximum is set, leaving the lower end unbounded.

 The maximum value is inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to <code>max</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withMaximumAmplifier(max as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                                |
| -------- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| max      | int | The maximum value the amplifier should be. |


### withMaximumDuration

Sets the maximum value the duration should be to <code>max</code>.

 If the duration had already some bounds specified, then the maximum value of the bound will be overwritten with the value specified in <code>max</code>. On the other hand, if the duration didn't have any bounds set, the maximum is set, leaving the lower end unbounded.

 The maximum value is inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to <code>max</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withMaximumDuration(max as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                               |
| -------- | --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| max      | int | The maximum value the duration should be. |


### withMinimumAmplifier

Sets the minimum value the amplifier should be to <code>min</code>.

 If the amplifier had already some bounds specified, then the minimum value of the bound will be overwritten with the value specified in <code>min</code>. On the other hand, if the amplifier didn't have any bounds set, the minimum is set, leaving the upper end unbounded.

 The minimum value is inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to <code>min</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withMinimumAmplifier(min as int) as EffectData
```

| Параметр | Тип | Description                                |
| -------- | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
| min      | int | The minimum value the amplifier should be. |


### withMinimumDuration

Sets the minimum value the duration should be to <code>min</code>.

 If the duration had already some bounds specified, then the minimum value of the bound will be overwritten with the value specified in <code>min</code>. On the other hand, if the duration didn't have any bounds set, the minimum is set, leaving the upper end unbounded.

 The minimum value is inclusive, meaning that a value that is equal to <code>min</code> will pass the check.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withMinimumDuration(min as int) as EffectData

| Параметр | Тип | Description                               |
| -------- | --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| min      | int | The minimum value the duration should be. |


### withVisibility

Indicates that the effect's particles must be visible.

 If the predicate had already been set to check the opposite condition, the setting will be overwritten.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withVisibility() as EffectData
myEffectData.withVisibility();

### withoutAmbient

Indicates that the effect must not be environmental.

 If the predicate had already been set to check the opposite condition, the setting will be overwritten.

Return Type: [EffectData](/vanilla/api/predicate/EffectData)

```zenscript
EffectData.withoutAmbient() as EffectData
myEffectData.withoutAmbient();
