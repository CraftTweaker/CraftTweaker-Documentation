# EntityFlagsPredicate

Represents the predicate for an [MCEntity](/vanilla/api/entity/MCEntity)'s status flags.

 The status flags indicate whether the entity is currently burning, moving and at which speed, and whether it's a baby or an adult, for the entities that have a baby form.

 By default, the entity passes the check no matter what its status flags are.

## Импорт класса

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.EntityFlagsPredicate;
```
