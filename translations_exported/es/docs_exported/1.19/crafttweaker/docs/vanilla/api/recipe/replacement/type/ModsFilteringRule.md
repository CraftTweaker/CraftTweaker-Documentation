# ModsFilteringRule

Filters recipes that have been created by the given set of mods.

 Every mod is identified according to its mod id. Recipes have been created by a mod if their name as determined by [Recipe](/vanilla/api/recipe/type/Recipe)&lt;C&gt;#getId() has that mod id as the namespace.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.recipe.replacement.type.ModsFilteringRule;
```
