# Lista de ingredientes

This class was added by a mod with mod-id `crafttweaker`. So you need to have this mod installed if you want to use this feature.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.item.IngredientList;
```


## Implemented Interfaces
IngredientList implementa las siguientes interfaces. That means all methods defined in these interfaces are also available in IngredientList

- [IIngredient](/vanilla/api/items/IIngredient)
