# MCVector3d

A 3-dimensional vector, in a 3-dimensional vector space.

 This class is immutable, meaning its values cannot change, so it is safe to be stored as a key in maps or in collections.

 No, it's not an arrow.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.util.MCVector3d;
```
