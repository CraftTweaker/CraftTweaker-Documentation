# False

Builder to create a 'False' loot condition.

 A 'False' loot condition is guaranteed to always fail.

## 导入类

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.conditions.crafttweaker.False;
```


## 已实现的接口
False implements the following interfaces. That means all methods defined in these interfaces are also available in False
