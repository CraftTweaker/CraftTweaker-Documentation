# BlockState

Builder to create a 'BlockState' loot condition.

 The condition compares the block state obtained from the [LootContext](/vanilla/api/loot/LootContext) with the given one, passing only if they are exactly the same state.

 A 'BlockState' loot condition requires a block state to be built.
