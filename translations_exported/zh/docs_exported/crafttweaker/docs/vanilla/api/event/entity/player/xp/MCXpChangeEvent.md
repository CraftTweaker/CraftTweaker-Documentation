# MCXpChangeEvent

This event is fired when the player's xp count is changed. If the amount is positive the xp is being added. If the xp is negative, the xp is being removed. This event takes place before the xp has changed, allowing you to change the amount, or negate the change entirely.

The event is cancelable.

If the event is canceled, the xp will not change

The event does not have a result.
