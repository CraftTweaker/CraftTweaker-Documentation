# SequenceType

Represents the type of 'actor' a [Sequence](/vanilla/api/util/sequence/Sequence)&lt;T,U&gt; acts on and is used to ensure that [Sequence](/vanilla/api/util/sequence/Sequence)&lt;T,U&gt;s are ticked correctly.

 Some examples are a [Level](/vanilla/api/world/Level) or a [LivingEntity](/vanilla/api/entity/LivingEntity) (which is not yet implemented).

 Mods adding custom sequenceable actors (really anything that can be ticked) should make their own SequenceType and expose it to ZenScript.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.util.sequence.SequenceType;
```
