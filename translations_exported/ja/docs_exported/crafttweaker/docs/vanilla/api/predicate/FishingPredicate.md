# FishingPredicate

Represents a predicate for a fishing hook, as a specialization of [EntityPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/EntityPredicate).

 This predicate can be used to check various properties of the fishing hook entity, such as being used for fishing in open waters instead of a closed pond.

 By default, the entity passes the checks without caring about the entity type. If at least one of the properties is set, then the entity must be a fishing hook to pass the checks.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.FishingPredicate;
```


## Extending AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate

FishingPredicate extends [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate). That means all methods available in [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate) are also available in FishingPredicate

```zenscript
FishingPredicate.withClosedWaters() as FishingPredicate

 If the predicate had already been set to check the opposite condition, the setting will be overwritten.

Return Type: [FishingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/FishingPredicate)

```zenscript
FishingPredicate.withOpenWaters() as FishingPredicate
