# NameFilteringRule

Filters recipes that match a specific pattern on their name.

 This acts as a less specialized version of [ModsFilteringRule](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/type/ModsFilteringRule) as it allows custom matching on the entirety of a recipe's name as determined by [Recipe](/vanilla/api/recipe/type/Recipe)&lt;C&gt;#getId(), at the cost of some efficiency.

## Diese Klasse importieren

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.recipe.replacement.type.NameFilteringRule;
```

:::group{name=containing since="10.0.0"}

Creates a rule filtering recipes that have the given word in their name. <br />  <br />  The word is not matched exactly and word boundaries aren't considered.

Returns: A rule carrying out exactly what has been specified.  
Return Type: [NameFilteringRule](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/type/NameFilteringRule)

NameFilteringRule.containing(contents as string) as NameFilteringRule

| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| contents  | string | The contents to look for in the recipe's name. |
