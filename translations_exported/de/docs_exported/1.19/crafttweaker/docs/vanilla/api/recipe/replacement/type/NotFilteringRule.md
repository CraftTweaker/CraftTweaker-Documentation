# NotFilteringRule

Inverts a filtering rule.

 This rule should be used sparingly as it incurs a performance loss due to having to loop over all recipes multiple times to perform the inversion of the rule.

## Diese Klasse importieren

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.recipe.replacement.type.NotFilteringRule;
```
