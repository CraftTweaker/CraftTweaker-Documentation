# JeiRecipeGraphics

Allows a [JeiRecipe](/mods/JEITweaker/API/Recipe/JeiRecipe) to request additional graphic capabilities to its parent [JeiCategory](/mods/JEITweaker/API/Category/JeiCategory).

 Support for the various methods available depends on the category to which the recipe is being added to. Refer to the category documentation for more information. Namely, categories <strong>need not</strong> support nor acknowledge any of the requests specified by a recipe if they do not desire to do so.

## Importare la Classe

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import mods.jei.recipe.JeiRecipeGraphics;
```
