# IFilteringRule

Represents an [ITargetingFilter](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/ITargetingFilter) that can be applied by the user onto a [Replacer](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/Replacer).

 Much like a targeting filter, a filtering rule can remove a set of recipes from being able to be inspected by a `Replacer`. The same condition apply, meaning that the filter is <strong>positive</strong>: it specifies which recipes the replacer is <strong>allowed</strong> to inspect.

 For example, using a [ModsFilteringRule](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/type/ModsFilteringRule) indicates that <strong>only the specified mods</strong> will be targeted by the replacer.
