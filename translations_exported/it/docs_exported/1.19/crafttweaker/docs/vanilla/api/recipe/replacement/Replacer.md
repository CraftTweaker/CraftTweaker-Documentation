# Replacer

Handles the replacement of [IRecipeComponent](/vanilla/api/recipe/IRecipeComponent)&lt;T&gt;s for [Recipe](/vanilla/api/recipe/type/Recipe)&lt;C&gt;s.

 Due to the expensive nature of the replacing process, once the replacer is created, it is not immediately executed like with other calls, but rather the user needs to determine when the execution should occur with the [this](.)#execute() method. It is suggested to chain as many replacements as possible in a single invocation to avoid too big performance hits.

 A replacer instance can be created through [this](.)#create() and various filters specified through [this](.)#filter(IFilteringRule). Note that all filters are <strong>positive</strong>, meaning that they specify the set of recipes the replacer should target. Replacements can then be specified with the various `replace` methods. Refer to their documentation for more information.

## Importare la Classe

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.recipe.replacement.Replacer;
```


## Static Methods

:::group{name=create since="10.0.0"}

Creates a new replacer instance.

Returns: A new replacer instance.  
Return Type: [Replacer](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/Replacer)

```zenscript
// Replacer.create() as Replacer

Replacer.create();
```

:::

## Metodi

:::group{name=execute since="10.0.0"}

Executes the replacer, carrying out all replacements determined up until now.

 After this method is called, the replacer will be exhausted, meaning that a new replacer will be needed to carry out additional replacements.

```zenscript
// Replacer.execute()

Replacer.create().execute();
```

:::

:::group{name=filter since="10.0.0"}

Specifies an [IFilteringRule](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/IFilteringRule) that the replacer must follow.

 Note that the rules are <strong>positive</strong>, meaning that they specify the recipes that the replacer should act upon.

 You can specify as many filters as you want. Note that they will all be applied at the same time. For example, filtering for mod `"crafttweaker"` and with recipe type `<recipetype:minecraft:crafting>` will indicate that only recipes added by you to the crafting table will be targeted.

 A replacer cannot be modified after execution.

Returns: This for chaining.  
Return Type: [Replacer](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/Replacer)

```zenscript
Replacer.filter(rule as IFilteringRule) as Replacer
```

:::

:::group{name=replace since="10.0.0"}

Specifies a replacement that should be carried out by this replacer.

 In particular, the given [IRecipeComponent](/vanilla/api/recipe/IRecipeComponent)&lt;T&gt; will be used to query the recipe and alter exactly what has been specified. The first element is then used to determine what needs to be replaced and the second element indicates what the element should be replaced by. In other words, any instance of `toReplace` will be replaced by `with`.

 The replacement strategy used will be default one, so the components will be checked directly, without examining the various elements in detail. For example, a [IIngredient](/vanilla/api/ingredient/IIngredient) like `<item:minecraft:dirt> | <item:minecraft:diamond>` will be considered like a single entity. Attempting to replace only dirt, for example, won't work.

 A replacer cannot be modified after execution.

Returns: This replacer for chaining.  
Return Type: [Replacer](/vanilla/api/recipe/replacement/Replacer)

Replacer.replace<T : Object>(component as IRecipeComponent<T>, toReplace as T, with as T) as Replacer

:::group{name=replace since="10.0.0"}

Specifies a replacement that should be carried out by this replacer.

 In particular, the given [IRecipeComponent](/vanilla/api/recipe/IRecipeComponent)&lt;T&gt; will be used to query the recipe and alter exactly what has been specified. The predicate will be used to determine whether a specific target needs to be replaced, whereas the function will determine what the element should be replaced by. In other words, any instance that makes `toReplace` return `true` will be replaced by the result of the execution of `with`.

 The strategy used can be determined by you, allowing for example to consider each element in detail instead of directly. For example, a [IIngredient](/vanilla/api/ingredient/IIngredient) like `<item:minecraft:dirt> | <item:minecraft:diamond>` can also be considered as two separate ingredients and thus replacing only dirt can happen.

 A replacer cannot be modified after execution.

Returns: This replacer for chaining.
