# BlockState

Builder to create a 'BlockState' loot condition.

 The condition compares the block state obtained from the [LootContext](/vanilla/api/loot/LootContext) with the given one, passing only if they are exactly the same state.

 A 'BlockState' loot condition requires a block state to be built.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.conditions.crafttweaker.BlockState;
```
