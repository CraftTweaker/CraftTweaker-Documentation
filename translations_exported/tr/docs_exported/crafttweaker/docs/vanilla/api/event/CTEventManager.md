# CTEventManager

The event Manager is your go-to point if you want to register custom event handlers.

 You can register EventHandlers for everything that derives from [MCEvent](/vanilla/api/event/MCEvent). Make sure to tell ZC of the type you are using, so that you can access the event's properties.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.events.CTEventManager;
```


## Methods

### register

Registers a new Event listener.

Return Type: void

```zenscript
CTEventManager.register<T : MCEvent>(consumer as Consumer<T>) as void
CTEventManager.register<crafttweaker.api.event.entity.player.MCAnvilRepairEvent>((event) => {
     var player = event.player;
     var result = event.itemResult;
     println("Player '" + player.name + "' crafted " + result.commandString);
 });
CTEventManager.register<crafttweaker.api.event.MCEvent>((event) => {
     //Don't actually register a consumer for every event
     println("Some Event was captured");
 });
```
