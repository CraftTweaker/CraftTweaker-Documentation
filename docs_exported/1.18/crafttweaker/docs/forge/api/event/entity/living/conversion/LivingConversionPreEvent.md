# LivingConversionPreEvent

The event is triggered when an entity is trying to replace itself with another entity.
 This event may trigger every tick even if it was cancelled last tick for entities like Zombies and Hoglins.

The event is cancelable.

If the event is canceled, the replacement will not occur

The event does not have a result.



## Importing the class

```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.event.living.conversion.LivingConversionPreEvent;
```
