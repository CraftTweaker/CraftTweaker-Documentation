# Color4I

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import mods.sdmbestiary.bestiary.integration.ftblib.Color4I;
```


## Extending Icon

Color4I extends [Icon](/mods/sdmbestiary/bestiary/Icon). That means all methods available in [Icon](/mods/sdmbestiary/bestiary/Icon) are also available in Color4I

## Constructors


```zenscript
new Color4I(red as int, green as int, blue as int) as Color4I
```
| Parameter | Type |
|-----------|------|
| red       | int  |
| green     | int  |
| blue      | int  |
