# TriState

Represents a value that can assume three values, instead of a simple boolean that can only assume two values.

## 导入相关包

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.TriState;
```


## Extending Enum&lt;TriState&gt;
