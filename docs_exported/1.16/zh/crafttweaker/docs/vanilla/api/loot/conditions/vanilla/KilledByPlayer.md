# KilledByPlayer

Builder to create a 'KilledByPlayer' condition.

 This condition will pass if and only if the target of the loot table has been killed by the player, either directly or indirectly (such as with arrows).

## 导入相关包

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.conditions.vanilla.KilledByPlayer;
```
