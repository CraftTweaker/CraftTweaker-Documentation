# SurvivesExplosion

Builder to create a 'SurvivesExplosion' condition.

 This condition will pass if and only if the target of the loot table survives an explosion with the current radius, as specified by the [LootContext](/vanilla/api/loot/LootContext).

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.conditions.vanilla.SurvivesExplosion;
```
