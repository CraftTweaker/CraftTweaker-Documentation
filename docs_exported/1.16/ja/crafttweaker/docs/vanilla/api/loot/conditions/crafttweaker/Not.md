# Not

Builder to create a 'Not' condition.

 The sub-condition added to a 'Not' condition will be passed through the equivalent of a NOT gate, effectively inverting the result of the query. This makes this loot condition effectively a clone of [Inverted](/vanilla/api/loot/conditions/vanilla/Inverted) at the moment. This ensures a more coherent experience in case vanilla's behavior changes in the future, while also allowing the user to specify the logic gate directly.

 A 'Not' condition requires a sub-condition to be built.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.conditions.crafttweaker.Not;
```


## Implemented Interfaces
Not implements the following interfaces. That means all methods defined in these interfaces are also available in Not

- [ILootConditionTypeBuilder](/vanilla/api/loot/conditions/ILootConditionTypeBuilder)

## Methods

:::group{name=withCondition}

Sets the negated condition to the one created with the given [LootConditionBuilder](/vanilla/api/loot/conditions/LootConditionBuilder).

 The builder must host a single loot condition. Builders with a different amount of conditions are not allowed. The builder will be used to generate a loot condition that will then be used as sub-condition.

 This parameter is <strong>required</strong>.

Return Type: [Not](/vanilla/api/loot/conditions/crafttweaker/Not)

```zenscript
Not.withCondition(builder as LootConditionBuilder) as Not
```

| Parameter | Type                                                                      | Description                                                                                   |
