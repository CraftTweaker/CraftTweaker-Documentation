# BlockBuilder

The blockbuilder is used to... build blocks (you totally didn't see that one coming, right... right?).<br>
 Once you created it you can set various properties which will be outlined by the separate methods.
 <p>
 You can also change the block's type to create a more specialized form of block (e.g. stairs or Blocks that can be rotated in the same way logs can).
 To tell CoT that you want the block to appear ingame you need to call [this](.)#build(String) and specify a valid resource location path.

This class was added by a mod with mod-id `contenttweaker`. So you need to have this mod installed if you want to use this feature.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import mods.contenttweaker.block.BlockBuilder;
```


## Implemented Interfaces
BlockBuilder implements the following interfaces. That means all methods defined in these interfaces are also available in BlockBuilder

- [IIsBuilder](/mods/contenttweaker/API/api/IIsBuilder)
## Constructors

Creates a new BlockBuilder.
 Remember that this will _not_ create a new block in the game, you need to call [this](.)#build(String) for that.
```zenscript
new BlockBuilder(material as MCMaterial) as BlockBuilder
new BlockBuilder(<blockmaterial:earth>);
```
| Parameter | Type | Description | Optional | DefaultValue |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| material | [MCMaterial](/vanilla/api/block/material/MCMaterial) | The material this block will have | true | <blockmaterial:iron> |

## Methods

### notSolid

Instructs CoT that this block is not solid.
 <p>
 This is required if your model is not a full block (16x16x16).
 It is also required if your model is see-through (like glass).
 Set this if your block creates some X-Ray effects when it's placed.

Return Type: [BlockBuilder](/mods/contenttweaker/API/block/BlockBuilder)

```zenscript
BlockBuilder.notSolid() as BlockBuilder
myBlockBuilder.notSolid();
```
### withHardnessAndResistance
