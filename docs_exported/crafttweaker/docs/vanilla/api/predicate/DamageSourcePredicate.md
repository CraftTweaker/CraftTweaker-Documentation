# DamageSourcePredicate

Represents a predicate for a [DamageSource](/vanilla/api/util/DamageSource).

 The predicate can be used to match against a various set of types that identify the damage source type and
 characteristics, such as being caused by magic or bypassing invulnerability. Moreover, the predicate can also check
 for specific properties of the entity that caused the damage or the direct entity (refer to [TargetedEntity](/vanilla/api/predicate/TargetedEntity)
 for the semantic difference), via [EntityPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/EntityPredicate)s.

 By default, any damage source will pass this predicate's checks.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.DamageSourcePredicate;
```


## Extending AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate

DamageSourcePredicate extends [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate). That means all methods available in [AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/AnyDefaultingVanillaWrappingPredicate) are also available in DamageSourcePredicate

## Methods

:::group{name=withArmorBypass}

Indicates that the damage source must be able to bypass armor protection (for example, suffocation)

 If the predicate had already been set to check the opposite condition, the setting will be overwritten.

Return Type: [DamageSourcePredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/DamageSourcePredicate)

```zenscript
// DamageSourcePredicate.withArmorBypass() as DamageSourcePredicate

myDamageSourcePredicate.withArmorBypass();
```

:::

:::group{name=withDirectEntityPredicate}

Creates and sets the [EntityPredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/EntityPredicate) that will be used to check the entity that directly caused damage.

 For the specific semantic meaning, refer to [TargetedEntity](/vanilla/api/predicate/TargetedEntity).

 Any changes that have been made to the entity predicate previously, if any, will be discarded.

Return Type: [DamageSourcePredicate](/vanilla/api/predicate/DamageSourcePredicate)

```zenscript
DamageSourcePredicate.withDirectEntityPredicate(builder as Consumer<EntityPredicate>) as DamageSourcePredicate
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
