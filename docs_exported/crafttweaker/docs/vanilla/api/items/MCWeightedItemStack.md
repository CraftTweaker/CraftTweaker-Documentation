# MCWeightedItemStack

An ItemStack with a chance, usually used for recipe outputs.
 <p>
 Careful, if the stack that was used to create the WeightedStack was mutable, then the size setter will mutate the original stack as well!

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.item.MCWeightedItemStack;
```

## Constructors

new MCWeightedItemStack(<item:minecraft:bedrock>, 0.5D);
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
