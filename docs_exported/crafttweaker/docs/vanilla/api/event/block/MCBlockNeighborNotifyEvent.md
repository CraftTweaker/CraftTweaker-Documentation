# MCBlockNeighborNotifyEvent

Fired when a physics update occurs on a block. This event acts as
 a way for mods to detect physics updates, in the same way a BUD switch
 does. This event is only called on the server.

The event is cancelable.

If the event is canceled, vanilla logic won't be executed

The event does not have a result.



## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.event.block.MCBlockNeighborNotifyEvent;
```
