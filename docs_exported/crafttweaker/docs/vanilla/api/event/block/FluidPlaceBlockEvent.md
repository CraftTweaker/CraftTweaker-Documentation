# FluidPlaceBlockEvent

Fired when a fluid places a block. This can happen on one of two scenarios:
 1) When fluids touch each other, spawning a block (When Lava and Water touch they create Cobblestone).
 2) When Lava spawns fire around it.

 You can use this event to change what block is set, so you could replace cobblestone with something else.

The event is not cancelable.

The event does not have a result.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.event.block.FluidPlaceBlockEvent;
```
