# WeatherCheck

Builder for the 'WeatherCheck' loot condition.

 This condition checks the current in-game weather, ensuring that it matches the parameters specified in the condition
 itself.

 A well-formed 'WeatherCheck' loot condition must have at least one of the various possible states set. If that isn't
 the case, then the condition will simply pass no matter what, making its presence redundant.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.conditions.vanilla.WeatherCheck;
```
