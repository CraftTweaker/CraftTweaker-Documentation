# LootManager

The main entry point for everything loot related.

 This entry point can be obtained via the <code>loot</code> global in scripts and allows you to manipulate everything
 related to loot or query loot tables.

 Other mods may also expand the current possibilities, so check their documentation to see what additional entry
 points are available.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.loot.LootManager;
```
