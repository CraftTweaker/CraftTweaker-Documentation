# EnchantmentLevelSetEvent

The EnchantmentLevelSet Event is fired when the levels for the three potential enchantments are generated in the Enchantment Table.

## Notes

`event.enchantRow` lists the row (1-3) of the Enchantment Table, while `event.originalLevel` represents the original level of the row. `event.power` is the cumulative value of bookshelves surrounding the Enchantment Table, while `event.item` is the item that is being enchanted.

`event.level` can be arbitrarily modified to a value between 0 & 30.

## Event-Klasse
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.EnchantmentLevelSetEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Erweiterte Event-Schnittellen
EnchantmentLevelSet Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventPositionable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventPositionable/)
