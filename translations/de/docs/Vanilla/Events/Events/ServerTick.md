# ServerTick

The ServerTick Event is fired every tick on the server.

## Event-Klasse
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.ServerTickEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Erweiterte Event-Schnittellen
WorldTick Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [ITickEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ITickEvent/)

## ZenGetter
There is no additional information besides the information mentioned in the interfaces above.
