## Notes

- Please use lowercase names
- Pre-existing atomic numbers cannot be overwritten
- The '#loader alchemistry' line is required at the top of the file. This file can only be used to create elements and compounds, other recipes must be put in other files.
- NOTE: As of v1.0.2, The mod Resource Loader must be used to include the image and model json for custom elements. If you would like to auto-generate these resources I have created a command-line JAR program [here](https://github.com/al132mc/alchemistry-resource-creator/releases) to do so.
