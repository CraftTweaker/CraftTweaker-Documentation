# Astral Sorcery

Astral Sorcery is a magic mod focused around harnessing the powers of starlight and the constellations. Explore and discover the world and the sky above you; focus starlight to your will, strengthening yourself or enhancing the world around you.

## CraftTweaker integration

Astral Sorcery comes with NATIVE crafttweaker integration.  
This means that issues with the added methods should be discussed at the [Astral sorcery issue tracker](https://github.com/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/issues).

## Removed CraftTweaker methods

- Astral Sorcery's CraftTweaker integration once featured a Mineralis Ritual. This is now handled by a config option!
