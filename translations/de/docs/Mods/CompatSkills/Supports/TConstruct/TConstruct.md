# Tinker's Construct

## Notice

As of CompatSkills 1.9.0, TConstruct Locks now pass "up" to item-level. That way the tools are still inaccessible if a friend provides a crafted version.

## Commands

    // Dumps all Materials
    ~ /ct tinkermaterials
    
    // Dumps all Modifiers
    ~ /ct tinkermodifiers
    

## Tool-Creation Locks

By adding a normal ItemStack lock to any of the Tinker Tool-Types (not Part-Types!). You can lock the creation of a Tinker Tool-Type!
