# Mod-Lock Tweaker

## Mod-Locking

This was added as a capability for configs in 1.2.0 and now has a CrT ZenMethod implemented to support it. This can also be accomplished through the configs as previously mentioned.

Mod-Locks allow you to lock all ItemStacks from a specific mod behind a specific lock.

### Syntax:

    // Blank Example
    mods.compatskills.ModLock.addModLock(String modId, String... locked);
    
    // Working Example:
    mods.compatskills.ModLock.addModLock("minecraft", "reskillable:building|4");
    
    The above lock will lock everything from the mod "minecraft" behind a lock of "building 4"
