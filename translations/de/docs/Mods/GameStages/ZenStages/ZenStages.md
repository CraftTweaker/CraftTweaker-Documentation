# ZenStages

This mod is an add-on for most mods curated as GameStage addons which use the [GameStages API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/game-stages). ZenStages brings all the mods together to allow simple integration and tools to help make Staged modpacks that much easier to create.

ZenStages comes packed with useful methods to add staging to mobs, items etc.. along with a debug method to check that you have not staged something on more than one stage. Along with that the methods provided via the [Stage](/Mods/GameStages/ZenStages/Stage/) class or the [ZenStager](/Mods/GameStages/ZenStages/ZenStager/) class allow for dynamic management leading to cleaner CraftTweaker scripts!

More information about the mod can be found on the [CurseForge Page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/zenstages).
