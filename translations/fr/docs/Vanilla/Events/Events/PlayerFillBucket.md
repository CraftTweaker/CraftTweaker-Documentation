# PlayerFillBucket

The PlayerFillBucket Event is fired whenever a player fills a bucket.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerFillBucketEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerFillBucket Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IProcessableEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IProcessableEvent/)
- [IEventPositionable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventPositionable/)

## ZenGetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:
