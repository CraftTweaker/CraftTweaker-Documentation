# IBlockEvent

This interface is extended by all Events that can have a central living entity.

## Importing the class

It might be required to [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class to avoid errors.  
`import crafttweaker.event.IBlockEvent;`

## Extending IEventPositionable

This interface extends [IEventPositionable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventPositionable/), which means that all functionality that IEventPositionable offers is also present in IBlockEvent
