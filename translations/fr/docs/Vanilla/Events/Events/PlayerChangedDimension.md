# PlayerChangedDimension

The PlayerChangedDimension Event is fired whenever a [player's](/Vanilla/Players/IPlayer/) [dimension/world](/Vanilla/World/IWorld/) changes, for example upon entering/leaving the nether.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerChangedDimensionEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerChandedDimension Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)

## ZenGetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:
