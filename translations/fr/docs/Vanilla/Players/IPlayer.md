# IPlayer

The IPlayer interface allows you to view certain information on a specific player and interact with said one. Mostly used in Event Handlers and Recipe Functions.

## Importing the package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import crafttweaker.player.IPlayer;`

## Extending IEntityLivingBase and IUser

IPlayer extends [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase/). That means all functions available to [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase/) Objects also are available to IPlayer Objects.  
IPlayer also extends [IUser](/Vanilla/Players/IUser/). That means all functions available to [IUser](/Vanilla/Players/IUser/) Objects also are available to IPlayer Objects.

## Zengetters

Zengetters are for retrieving information. Usually either assigned to a variable or used in a method/function.
