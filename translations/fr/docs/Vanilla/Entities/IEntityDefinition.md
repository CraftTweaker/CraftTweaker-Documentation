# IEntityDefinition

This sounds scary, so what does it mean? Basically, it is a reference to an entity registered in the game, so it is a reference to, say a mob in the game.

## Importing the package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import crafttweaker.entity.IEntityDefinition;`

## Calling an IEntityDefinition Object

    //These return an IEntityDefinition Object
    val test = <entity:minecraft:sheep>;
    val test2 = game.getEntity("sheep");
    
    

## Functions

So, this is where it gets interesting: What can we do with it, now that we created that thing?

### id

Returns the ID as string

    //returns "net.minecraft.entity.passive.EntitySheep"
    <entity:minecraft:sheep>.id;
    

### name

Returns the name as string

    //returns "Sheep"
    <entity:minecraft:sheep>.name;
    

### create entity

The first method only creates an entity on the given location.  
The second one also spawns it.

    <entity:minecraft:sheep>.createEntity(world);
    <entity:minecraft:sheep>.spawnEntity(world, blockPos);
    

`world` is an [IWorld](/Vanilla/World/IWorld/) object.  
`blockPos` is an [IBlockPos](/Vanilla/World/IBlockPos/) object.

## Drops

We can even add and/or remove mob drops, isn't that great?

### Add normal Drop

This adds a normal drop, a drop that can occur whenever the mob is killed by whatever means.

    val entity = <entity:minecraft:sheep>;
    
    //addDrop(item,min,max,chance);
    entity.addDrop(<minecraft:apple>);
    
    //addDrop(weightedItem, min, max);
    entity.addDrop(<minecraft:stone> % 20);
    

`item` is the item to be added as drop and an [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack/) or a [WeightedItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/WeightedItemStack/).  
`min` is the minimum amount that is dropped and an Integer. This is optional.  
`max` is the maximum amount that is dropped and an Integer. This is optional.  
`chance` is the drop chance. This is optional. Not needed if you use a [weightedItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/WeightedItemStack/) instead as `item`

### Add playeronly drop

Same as normal drops, but only if the entity was killed by a player.

    //addPlayerOnlyDrop(item,min,max,chance);
    entity.addPlayerOnlyDrop(<minecraft:gold_ingot>, 10,64);
    
    //addPlayerOnlyDrop(weightedItem, min, max);
    entity.addPlayerOnlyDrop(<minecraft:iron_ingot> % 20, 1, 3);
    

### Add drop Function

A drop function is called whenever the associated Entity is killed. You can use this if you need to check requirements for before you drop something, like only dropping in a certain biome and stuff.  
You will need an [IEntityDropFunction](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityDropFunction/):

    <entity:minecraft:sheep>.addDropFunction(function(entity, dmgSource) {
        return <minecraft:iron_ingot> * 10;
        });
    

### Remove

This removes a drop.

    val entity = <entity:minecraft:sheep>;
    
    //removeDrop(item);
    entity.removeDrop(<minecraft:wool>);
    

`item` is the item to be removed from being a drop and an [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack/).

### Clear Drops

This removes all drops.

    val entity = <entity:minecraft:sheep>;
    
    //clearDrops
    entity.clearDrops();
    

### Get

This returns all drops that were added via CT as list of [IEntityDrop](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityDrop/) Objects.

    val entity = <entity:minecraft:sheep>;
    
    //getDrops();
    val dropList = entity.getDrops();
