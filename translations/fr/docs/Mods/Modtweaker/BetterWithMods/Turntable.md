# Turntable

## Basic Recipe

* Adds Turntable Recipe - inputs *MUST* have a block associated with them. The product state is the block that will be placed after the recipe finishes

    mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.add(IIngredient input, IItemStack productState, IItemStack[] output);
    
    mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.add(IIngredient input, IItemStack[] output);
    
    //Examples
    mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.add(<minecraft:grass>, <minecraft:dirt>, [<minecraft:seed>]);
    
    mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.add(<minecraft:gravel>, [<minecraft:flint>]);
    

## Removal by input

* Remove a recipe based on the input ingredient ```mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.remove(IIngredient input);```

## Removal by output

* Remove a recipe based on the output ```mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.remove(IItemStack[] outputs);```

## Remove all

* Remove all recipes ```mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.removeAll();```

## Remove by product

* Remove a recipe by the productState  
        mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.removeRecipe(IItemStack productState);

## Builder

The Turntable has a recipe builder that allows more precise control over the recipes. All previous methods are simply short cuts to using the builder.

* To create a new Turntable builder. `mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.builder()`

* Turntable methods
    
    * Sets up the inputs and outputs of the recipe  
            buildRecipe(IIngredient[] inputs, IItemStack[] outputs)
    
    * Sets the rotations required for the recipe to finish. This defaults to 8.  
            setRotations(int rotations)
    
    * Set the block that is placed when the recipe is finished.  
            setProductState(IItemStack productState)
    
    * Finalize the recipe and add it to the game  
            build()

### Example builder usage

    mods.betterwithmods.Turntable.builder()
    .buildRecipe([<minecraft:oak_fence>], [<minecraft:stick>*6])
    .build();
