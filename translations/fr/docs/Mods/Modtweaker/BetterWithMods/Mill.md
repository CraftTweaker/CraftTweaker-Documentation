# Mill

## Basic Recipe

* Adds a Mill Recipe 

    mods.betterwithmods.Mill.addRecipe(IIngredient[] inputs, IItemStack[] outputs);
    //Examples
    mods.betterwithmods.Mill.addRecipe([<minecraft:dirt>],[<minecraft:stone>]);
    

## Removal

* Remove a Mill recipe based on the output ```mods.betterwithmods.Mill.remove(IItemStack[] outputs);```

* Remove all Mill recipes ```mods.betterwithmods.Mill.removeAll();```

## Builder

The Mill has a recipe builder that allows more precise control over the recipes. All previous methods are simply short cuts to using the builder.

* To create a new Mill builder. `mods.betterwithmods.Mill.builder()`

* Mill builder methods
    
    * Sets up the inputs and outputs of the recipe  
            buildRecipe(IIngredient[] inputs, IItemStack[] outputs)
    
    * Sets the priority of the recipe, the lower the priority the sooner it will be crafted. Default=0.  
            setPriority(int priority)
    
    * Set the sound of a Mill Recipe.  
            setSound(String soundLocation)
    
    * Finalize the recipe and add it to the game  
            build()
