# Kiln

## Basic Recipe

* Adds Kiln Recipe - inputs *MUST* have a block associated with them.

    mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.add(IIngredient input, IItemStack[] output);
    //Examples
    mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.add(<minecraft:fence>,[<minecraft:stick>,<minecraft:stick>]);
    

## Removal by input

* Remove a recipe based on the input ingredient ```mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.remove(IIngredient input);```

## Removal by output

* Remove a recipe based on the output ```mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.remove(IItemStack[] outputs);```

## Remove all

* Remove all recipes ```mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.removeAll();```

## Builder

The Kiln has a recipe builder that allows more precise control over the recipes. All previous methods are simply short cuts to using the builder.

* To create a new Kiln builder. `mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.builder()`

* Kiln methods
    
    * Sets up the inputs and outputs of the recipe  
            buildRecipe(IIngredient[] inputs, IItemStack[] outputs)
    
    * Set the Heat requirements of the recipe. Heat is used to check if the recipe can be made in a stoked or unstoked cauldron. Unstoked heat = 1, Stoked heat = 2. You can add custom heat sources, and even custom heat levels using the [Heat Registry](/Mods/Modtweaker/BetterWithMods/HeatRegistry/).  
            setHeat(int heat)
    
    * Set the recipe to ignore the heat value and craft anyways  
            setIgnoreHeat(boolean ignoreHeat)
    
    * Finalize the recipe and add it to the game  
            build()

### Example builder usage

    mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.builder()
    .buildRecipe([<ore:iron>], [<minecraft:iron_ingot>*2])
    .setHeat(2)
    .build();
    

## Structure Block

The Kiln is a multiblock based on the block it is made of; This allows registering a block that can be used to create the structure.

Input MUST be a *Block*

       mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.registerBlock(IItemStack input);
    
       mods.betterwithmods.Kiln.registerBlock(<minecraft:stonebrick>);
