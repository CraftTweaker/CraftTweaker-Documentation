# Skill Hiding / Visibility Locking

This lock allows you to hide Skills until the point where a player fulfills the requirements to see the skill. This has some limited use-cases for example when adding "Class" Skills in Custom-Packs where you don't want someone who is an "Engineer" to see or be able to get access to the "Mage" skill page.

## Syntax:

    Blank Example:
    mods.compatskills.VisibilityLock.addVisibilityLock(CTSkill skill, String... Default Requirements);
    
    Working Example:
    mods.compatskills.VisibilityLock.addVisibilityLock(<skill:reskillable:attack>, "dim|1");
