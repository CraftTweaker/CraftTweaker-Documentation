# XNOR Operator

An **XNOR** gate is an inverted **XOR** gate. This is the same as using the output of the **XOR** gate as the input to the **NOT** gate. This means that the **XNOR** gate returns `TRUE` only when both inputs are the same state. Either both are `TRUE` or both are `FALSE`.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------:|
| 0       | 0       |      1 |
| 0       | 1       |      0 |
| 1       | 0       |      0 |
| 1       | 1       |      1 |
