# IKWID Preprocessor

This preprocessor will make it that all logger warnings and errors aren't printed to the player chat.

## Appel

You call the IKWID Preprocessor by adding `#ikwid` to your script file.

## Ce qu'il fait

It globally suppresses errors and warnings to send to players' chat. It is only supposed to be used when you are already done with development and want to suppress false positive errors from the user.
