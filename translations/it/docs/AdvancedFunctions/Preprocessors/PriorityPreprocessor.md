# PriorityPreprocessor

The Priority Preprocessor allows you to give your scripts a loading priority.

## Call

You call the Priority Preprocessor by adding `#priority number` to your script with `number` being the priority number you want to set.

## What it does

The higher a script's priority the earlier it is getting executed.  
Scripts with the same priority will be sorted alphabetically using their pathname.
