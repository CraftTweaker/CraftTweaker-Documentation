# PlayerAnvilRepair

The PlayerAnvilRepair Event is fired whenever a player crafts something in the anvil.  
You can change the chance that the anvil is damaged.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:

You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.
