# IEntityXp

Represents an XP Orb in the world.

## Importing the package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import crafttweaker.entity.IEntityXp;`

## Extending [IEntity](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntity/)

IEntityXp extends [IEntity](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntity/). That means all functions available to [IEntities](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntity/) also are available to IEntityXp.
