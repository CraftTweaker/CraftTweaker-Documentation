# IPlayerEvent

This interface is extended by all events that have a player.  
That means you can use the getter below to access the player.

## Importing the class

It might be required to [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class to avoid errors.  
`import crafttweaker.event.IPlayerEvent;`

## Extending ILivingEvent

This interface extends [ILivingEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ILivingEvent/), which means that all functionality that ILivingEvent offers is also present in IPlayerEvent
