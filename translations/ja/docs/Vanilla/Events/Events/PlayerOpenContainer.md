# PlayerOpenContainer

The PlayerOpenContainer Event is fired whenever a player opens a container.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerOpenContainerEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerOpenContainer Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)

## ZenGetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:

| ZenGetter   | Return Type                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |

| `player`    | [IPlayer](/Vanilla/Players/IPlayer/)         |
| `container` | [IContainer](/Vanilla/Container/IContainer/) |
