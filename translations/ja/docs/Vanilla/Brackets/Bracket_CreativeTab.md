# Creative Tab Bracket Handler

The Creative Tab Bracket Handler gives you access to the creative Tabs in the game.

They are referenced in the Creative Tab handler this way:

    <creativetab:name>
    
    <creativetab:misc>
    

If the Creative Tab is found, this will return an ICreativeTab Object. Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Vanilla/CreativeTabs/ICreativeTab/) for further information on what you can do with these.
