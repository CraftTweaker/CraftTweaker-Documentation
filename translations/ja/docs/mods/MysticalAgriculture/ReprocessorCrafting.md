# Mystical Agriculture Reprocessor Crafting

Reprocessor Crafting is ***NOT*** a type of [IRecipeManager](/vanilla/api/managers/IRecipeManager) and normal removal methods will not work for it.

## Package


:::group{name="Importing The Package"}

You may want to import the class so you don't need to use the full package name everywhere, to do this simply add the following to the top of your script:

```zenscript

```

Now you can reference the class like so:
```zenscript
ReprocessorCrafting.addRecipe("reprocessor_test", <item:minecraft:diamond>, <item:minecraft:apple>);
```
