# Loom

## Package
```zenscript
import mods.terrafirmacraft.Loom;Loom;
```

## 追加

```zenscript
Loom.addRecipe(String registryName, IIngredient input, IItemStack output, int steps, String loomTexture);
```
- steps is the number of steps needed to complete the recipe. It's the number of times the player has to click the loom, each movement of the loop advances one step. Within TFC, this is the same as the number of items required for the recipe, but it is not required to be so.
- loomTexture is a path (`ResourceLocation`) to a texture file, to be used to display on the loom in the world.(For example, "minecraft:textures/blocks/wool_colored_white.png" references the vanilla texture for white wool). If you are using custom textures you need some form of data/resource loading (read: a resource pack) for this to be able to reference your texture correctly.

## 削除

```zenscript
Loom.removeRecipe(IItemStack output);
Loom.removeRecipe(String registryName);
```
