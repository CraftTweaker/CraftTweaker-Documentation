# PlayerInteract

The PlayerInteract Event is fired whenever a player interacts with a block.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerInteractEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerInteract Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IEventPositionable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventPositionable/)

## ZenGetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:

| ZenGetter    | Return Type                          |
