# ItemToss

The ItemToss Event is fired whenever an Item is being tossed from a player's inventory.  
Canceling this event will prevent the item from entering the world, thus causing the item to be deleted.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.ItemTossEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerDeathDrops Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEntityEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEntityEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
