# IEntityLiving

A living Entity is one that has health and that can die.  
Unlike [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase/) however, players don't are IEnitiyLiving objects!

## Importing the package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import crafttweaker.entity.IEntityLiving;`

## Extending [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase/)

IEntityLiving extends [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase/). That means all functions available to [IEntityLivingBase](/Vanilla/Entities/IEntityLivingBase/) objects also are available to IEntityLiving objects.
