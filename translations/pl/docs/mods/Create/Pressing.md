### This support is added by [CreateTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/createtweaker), you need [CreateTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/createtweaker) for this to work.

The Pressing mechanic is a type of [IRecipeManager](/vanilla/api/managers/IRecipeManager) and implements all the methods that are available to IRecipeManager's, such as `removeRecipe()` and `removeAll()`.

## Methods

#### Add Recipe

The following script will add a recipe that will output a Diamond and an Apple 45% of the time when a piece of Dirt is Pressed.

```zenscript
// <recipetype:create:pressing>.addRecipe(String name, MCWeightedItemStack[] output, IIngredient input)
<recipetype:create:pressing>.addRecipe("pressing_test", [<item:minecraft:diamond>, <item:minecraft:apple> % 45], <item:minecraft:dirt>);
```

#### Remove Recipes

The follow script will remove all Pressing recipes that output Paper.

```zenscript
// <recipetype:create:pressing>.removeRecipe(IItemStack output);
<recipetype:create:pressing>.removeRecipe(<item:minecraft:paper>);
```
