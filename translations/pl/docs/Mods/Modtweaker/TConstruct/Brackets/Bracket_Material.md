# ITICMaterial Bracket Handler

The Material Part Bracket Handler gives you access to the [Tinkers' Materials](/Mods/Modtweaker/TConstruct/Materials/ITICMaterial/) in the game. It is only possible to get Materials registered in the game, so you need to be careful when adding or removing certain mods.

Materials are referenced in the Material Bracket handler this way:

    <ticmat:mat>
    
    <ticmat:stone>
    

If the ITICMaterial is found, this will return an [ITICMaterial](/Mods/Modtweaker/TConstruct/Materials/ITICMaterial/) Object.  
Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Mods/Modtweaker/TConstruct/Materials/ITICMaterial/) for further information on what you can do with these.
