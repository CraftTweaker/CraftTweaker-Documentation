### Important!:

You might notice a lot of references to "String..." in the blank examples. This is called a VarArg. It essentially means you can feed it any number of said variable this case "String".

Example: "reskillable:building|15", "reskillable:magic|7", "stage|test", "adv|minecraft:husbandry/plant_seed"

Currently there is only 1 support not using the VarArg approach which is Requirement Locking through CrT. This will be switched over in the 1.2.0 release!
