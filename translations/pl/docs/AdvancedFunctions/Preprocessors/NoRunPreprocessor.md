# NoRun Preprocessor

The NoRun Preprocessor disables the script from being loaded COMPLETELY.

## Call

You call the NoRun Preprocessor by adding `#norun` to your script file.

## What it does

It completely disables the script it's added to from being loaded into the game.  
Though `/ct syntax` will still show script issues in that file!
