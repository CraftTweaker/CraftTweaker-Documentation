# EntityLivingAttacked

The EntityLivingAttacked Event is fired whenever an entity is being attacked.  
It can be canceled to stop the entity from taking damage.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.EntityLivingAttackedEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerDeathDrops Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [ILivingEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/ILivingEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)
