# BlockHarvestDropsEvent

The BlockHarvestDrops Event is fired whenever a block is about to drop its items.  
You can modify the block list as well as the overall drop chance. Set latter to 1 if you do all chance handling beforehand.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.BlockHarvestDropsEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

BlockHarvestDrops Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IBlockEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IBlockEvent/)

## ZenGetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:
