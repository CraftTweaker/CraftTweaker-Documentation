# PlayerAnvilUpdate

The PlayerAnvilUpdate Event is fired when a player places items in both the left and right slots of a anvil.
 * If the event is canceled, vanilla behavior will not run, and the output will be set to null.
 * If the event is not canceled, but the output is not null, it will set the output and not run vanilla behavior.
 * if the output is null, and the event is not canceled, vanilla behavior will execute.

## Event Class
You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerAnvilUpdateEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions
PlayerAnvilUpdate Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)


## ZenGetters & ZenSetters
The following information can be retrieved from the event:
