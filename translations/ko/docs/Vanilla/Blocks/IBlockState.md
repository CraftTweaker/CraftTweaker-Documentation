# IBlockState

IBlockState 객체는 블럭 하나의 현재 상태를 나타냅니다. 

## 패키지 임포트하기

후회없이 사용하고 이슈없이 진행을 하기 위해서는 패키지를 임포트해야만 합니다.  
`import crafttweaker.block.IBlockState;`

## IBlockState객체 호출

몇몇 메소드들이 IBlockState를 반환합니다.

- [Bracket Handler](/Vanilla/Brackets/Bracket_BlockState/)`<blockstate:minecraft:log:variant=spruce>`를 사용
- 정적 메소드 `IBlockState.getBlockState()`를 사용 (자세한 내용은 이후 내용을 확인하세요)
- Using the `getMatchingBlockStates()` method on an [IBlockStateMatcher](/Vanilla/Blocks/IBlockStateMatcher/) object to retrieve an array of IBlockStates.
- Using the `withProperty()` method on another IBlockState object.

## Resolving an IBlockState At Runtime

There may be times at which your script may rely on interaction with a block from a mod that has not been loaded yet, such as inside block events in ContentTweaker or another pre-init script loader. If you attempt to use a [Bracket Handler](/Vanilla/Brackets/Bracket_BlockState/) for a block that has not yet been registered, the handler will fail to resolve and your script will not work.

To avoid this, you can use the static `IBlockState.getBlockState()` method to resolve an IBlockState at runtime.

### static getBlockState

`static IBlockState getBlockState(String blockname, String... properties)` Parameters:

- String blockname → A string in the format "modid:blockname" as it would appear in the [BlockState Bracket Handler](/Vanilla/Brackets/Bracket_BlockState/)
- String... properties → Zero or more strings of `"name=value"` pairs of properties to apply to this blockstate. Any unspecified properties will use the same value as in the default blockstate for the specified block name.

Returns an IBlockState of the specified `blockname` with the specified `properties`, or the default blockstate if no properties are specified.

## Extending IBlockProperties

IBlockState extends [IBlockProperties](/Vanilla/Blocks/IBlockProperties/). That means that all methods that are available to [IBlockProperties](/Vanilla/Blocks/IBlockProperties/) objects are also available to IBlockState objects.

## Extending IBlockStateMatcher

IBlockState extends [IBlockStateMatcher](/Vanilla/Blocks/IBlockStateMatcher/). That means that all methods that are available to [IBlockStateMatcher](/Vanilla/Blocks/IBlockStateMatcher/) objects are also available to IBlockState objects.

| commandString | string                            | Returns a possible [Bracket Handler](/Vanilla/Brackets/Bracket_BlockState/) for this state |

## ZenMethods

### isReplacable

`boolean isReplaceable(IWorld world, IBlockPos pos);`  
Parameters:

- [IWorld](/Vanilla/World/IWorld/) world → The world to be checked in
- [IBlockPos](/Vanilla/World/IBlockPos/) pos → The Block's position

Returns a boolean that sais whether the block can be replaced or not.

### Getting or changing Properties

You can get a list of all registered properties, either as list with all property names or as map that maps the properties to their value.  
You can also check which values are possible for a given property name.  
You can also use `withProperty` to create a new IBlockState object with that property changed.

```zenscript
List<String> getPropertyNames();
String getPropertyValue(String name);
List<String> getAllowedValuesForProperty(String name);

IBlockState withProperty(String name, String value);
```

### Comparing two IBlockState objects

You can either use `int compare(IBlockState other);` or the ZenCompare Tokens `==` `!=`.  
The return different types though:

- `state.compare(other)` returns an int that is 0 if they are equal
- `state == other` returns a bool that is true of they are equal

### Getting an explicit Blockstate Matcher

Returns an [IBlockStateMatcher](/Vanilla/Blocks/IBlockStateMatcher/) that matches the given block.

```zenscript
IBlockStateMatcher matchBlock();
```
