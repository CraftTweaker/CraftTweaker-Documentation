# Immersive Engineering

## Credits:

Credits goes out to Skysom for helping guide me through this and for allowing me to rework some of his code from MultiblockStages!

## Explaination:

Immersive Engineering-Support currently consists of:

- A Command for dumping the string name of all IE Multiblocks. 
    - Command is: /ct ieMultiBlocks
- Multiblock Gating using a Crt-based Syntax.

### Syntax:

    Blank Example:
    mods.compatskills.IEMultiBlockGate.addGate(String multiBlockName, String failureMessage, String... defaultRequirements);
    
    Working Example:
    mods.compatskills.IEMultiBlockGate.addGate("IE:DieselGenerator", "I'm afraid this is just too complex for an idiot like you!", "reskillable:building|15", "reskillable:magic|7", "stage|test", "adv|minecraft:husbandry/plant_seed");
