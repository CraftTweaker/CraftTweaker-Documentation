# Block Harvest-Level Locking

## Feature:

This lock makes it so the player can't break a block with the set Harvest-Level unless a set of Requirements are met. For example below, you can see that Blocks with a Harvest-Level of 3 can only be broken in the End. This example is not really that great in practice, but it does show what this type of lock is capable of doing.

## Syntax:

    mods.compatskills.HarvestLock.addBlockLevelLock(int level, String... requirements);
    
    mods.compatskills.HarvestLock.addBlockLevelLock(3, "dim|1");
