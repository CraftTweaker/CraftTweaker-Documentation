# Material Representation

A Material representation represents a Tinkers' Construct Material.  
You can get such an object either from the [Material Builder](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/MaterialBuilder/) or from the [Material Bracket Handler](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Brackets/Bracket_Material/).

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the class if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import mods.contenttweaker.tconstruct.Material`

## Adding material items

If you use the given item in the part builder, you can set how many materialpoints that will give, or how much the item will repair.

    //myMaterial.addItem(IIngredient item, @Optional(1) int amountNeeded, @Optional(144) int amountMatched));
    myMaterial.addItem(<item:minecraft:iron_pickaxe>);
    myMaterial.addItem(<item:minecraft:iron_block>, 4, 288);
    

- `item` is the item that is matched against. You can use [Item Conditions](/Vanilla/Items/Item_Conditions/) but no Transformers. 
- `amountNeeded` is the amount of items that is matched against. You can split them over all the slots the toolforge provides, which also allows you to go above 64. In the second example above, you need 4 iron blocks per addition. Defaults to 1.
- `amountMatched` is the amount of material points added per `amountNeeded`. In the second example above four iron blocks give two material points. Defaults to 144 (one ingot/one Material value).

## Adding Material Traits

You can add a trait to the material.  
All items made from this material will then have this trait.  
Uses a [Trait Representation](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Trait/) or a String with the identifier (recommended), returns void.  
You can also provide a dependency String, that will cause the trait to only be available for certain part types, like heads, for example. Omitting that parameter will inject null, which will cause the trait to only be on the part type when no other nonnull dependency modifiers are on that part already.

The string varaint is recommended, since by the time CoT runs, most Traits aren't yet available, and even by the time CrT runs, not all of them have been initialized, but if you use the strings, the addition of the materials is postponed until they are available. Still it's not errorproof and there's no easy way of checking for typos, so beware the error messages telling you which traits haven't been findable.

    myMaterial.addTrait("fiery", "head");
    myMaterial.addTrait(<ticontrait:fiery>);
