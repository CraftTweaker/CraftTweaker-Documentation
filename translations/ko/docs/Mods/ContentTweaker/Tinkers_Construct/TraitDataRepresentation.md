# Trait Data Representation

A Trait data representation represents a Tinkers' Construct Trait's Data and is ItemBound.  
You can get such an object from an existing [Trait](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Trait/) object by supplying an IItemStack to the `getData` method.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the class if you encounter any issues (like casting an [Array](/AdvancedFunctions/Arrays_and_Loops/)), so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import mods.contenttweaker.tconstruct.TraitDataRepresentation`
