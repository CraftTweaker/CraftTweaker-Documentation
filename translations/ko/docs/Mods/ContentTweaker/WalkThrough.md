# Walk-Through

## After Install

First things first, before starting to create Blocks and such, it is suggested you run Minecraft at least once with ContentTweaker installed. This will allow ContentTweaker to create the resource folder that it needs.

## Important Folders

ContentTweaker should create an extra folder in your minecraft directory: "resources". The resources folder will be where all models, textures, and language files will be found. More on this folder will be explained later. The "scripts" folder added by CraftTweaker is where you should put all ContentTweaker scripts, however ContentTweaker scripts should begin with ```#loader contenttweaker``` at the top of the file.

## First Block

So for the best example of how ContentTweaker's content works, I'll be showing you one of the basic content pieces you will be creating, a block. There is other content that can be created, but I won't be including them in this walk-through. So first up, here is the script for the block I will using as example. Explanation of these methods can be found at the Blocks Page.

    #loader contenttweaker
    
    import mods.contenttweaker.VanillaFactory;
    import mods.contenttweaker.Block;
    
    var antiIceBlock = VanillaFactory.createBlock("anti_ice", <blockmaterial:ice>);
    antiIceBlock.setLightOpacity(3);
    antiIceBlock.setLightValue(0);
    antiIceBlock.setBlockHardness(5.0);
    antiIceBlock.setBlockResistance(5.0);
    antiIceBlock.setToolClass("pickaxe");
    antiIceBlock.setToolLevel(0);
    antiIceBlock.setBlockSoundType(<soundtype:snow>);
    antiIceBlock.setSlipperiness(0.3);
    antiIceBlock.register();
    

This will create a Block that looks and acts slightly like Minecraft's Ice Block. You will want to put this script in the 'scripts' folder, following the same rules as in CraftTweaker's scripts.

## Resources

You will also need to take a .png file and put it into 'resources/contenttweaker/textures/blocks' (This folder should be created for you, if you have run ContentTweaker already) The name of the file should match the name you put into createBlock, which in this case is 'anti_ice'. If you are planning on using a default cube shape with the block, ContentTweaker will generate the model jsons needed for it to function correctly.

The other part for this will be the language file. ContentTweaker will have already generated the en_us.lang file you will need to a line that will look like `tile.contenttweaker.<block_name>.name=Block name` or in our case with the AntiIce it will be `tile.contenttweaker.anti_ice.name=Anti Ice`. With both lang and texture filed in, you should be able to load up the game and see your block which will have a model, texture, and name.
