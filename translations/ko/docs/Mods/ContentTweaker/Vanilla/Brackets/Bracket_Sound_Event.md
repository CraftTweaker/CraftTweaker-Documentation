# Sound Event Bracket Handler

The SoundEvent Bracket Handler gives you access to the SoundEvents in the game.  
Check [this](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sounds.json) for a list of vanilla sound events!

SoundTypes are referenced in the Sound Event Bracket handler this way:

Vanilla

    <soundevent:name>
    
    <soundevent:ambient.cave>
    

Mod Added

    <soundevent:modID:name>
    
    <soundevent:minecraft:ambient.cave>
    

If the soundType is found, this will return an [ISoundEventDefinition](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Types/Sound/ISoundEventDefinition/) Object.
