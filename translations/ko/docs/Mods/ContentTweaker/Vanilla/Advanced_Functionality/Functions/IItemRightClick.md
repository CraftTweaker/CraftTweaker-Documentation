# IItemRightClick

The IItemRightClick function can be added to an [Item](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Creatable_Content/Item/) and will be triggered when a user does rightclick with the item selected in his primary hand.

## Importing the package

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues, so better be safe than sorry and add the import.  
`import mods.contenttweaker.IItemRightClick;`

- [IMutableItemStack](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Types/Item/IMutableItemStack/) itemStack → The item that is right-clicked

- [ICTPlayer](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Types/Player/ICTPlayer/) player → The player doing the right-click
