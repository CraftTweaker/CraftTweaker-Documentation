# Waila Stages

This mod is an addon for the [GameStages API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/game-stages). Waila Stages allows aspects of the Waila/Hwyla hud to be restricted by a custom progression system.

mods.WailaStages.addWailaStage("one");
```

Hides a specific line in the waila hud, unless the player has the stage.
