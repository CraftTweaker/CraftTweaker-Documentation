# NoWarnPreprocessor

This preprocessor will make it that all logger warnings aren't printed to the player chat.

## 호출

You call the no warn Preprocessor by adding `#nowarn` to your script file.

## 역할

It globally suppresses warnings to send to players' chat. The only thing that differs from [`#ikwid`](/AdvancedFunctions/Preprocessors/IKWIDPreprocessor) is that it doesn't suppress errors.
