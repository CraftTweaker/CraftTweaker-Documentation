# Setting up GitHub

In order to start, you need a free Account for [Github](https://github.com).  
Follow the registration steps if you have none already.

## Locating the repository

The wiki repository can be found at <https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker-Documentation>

## Forking the wiki

In order for you to do any changes, you need to copy the whole CrT-Wiki Repository to your Github Account.  
This action is called forking.  
You can fork the repository by clicking on the "fork" button in the wiki's GH page: ![Inputs Order](/Contribute/assets/SetupGitHub_ForkButton.png)

In case you are in a Github organization you might need to specify where you want to fork the repository to.

## Locating your fork

You can now find a new repository called "CraftTweaker-Documentation" when checking your profile page/repositories.  
Alternatively, you can go to `github.com/yourUserName/CraftTweaker-Documentation`.

## How to continue

Now that you have successfully forked the Crafttweaker-Documentation repository to your own GitHub account, you can [use the online Editor](/Contribute/OnlineEditor_Edit/) or [clone to your computer](/Contribute/LocalClone/Clone/) and edit locally.
