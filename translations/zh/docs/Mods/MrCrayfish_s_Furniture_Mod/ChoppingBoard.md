# Chopping Board

The Chopping Board allows you to chop up an item into many pieces of another item.

By default only cuts bread into 6 bread slices.

## Removing Chopping Recipes

## Remove matching chopping recipes.

```java
mods.cfm.ChoppingBoard.remove(@Optional final IIngredient output, @Optional final IIngredient input);

// Remove recipe with bread as the input item
mods.cfm.ChoppingBoard.remove(null,<minecraft:bread>);
// Remove recipes that result in 6 bread slices (same match as above recipe, so will have no effect if used after)
mods.cfm.ChoppingBoard.remove(<cfm:item_bread_slice>.withAmount(6));
```

## Adding Chopping Recipes

Add a chopping recipe.

## Input requires stack size of 1.

```java
mods.cfm.ChoppingBoard.addRecipe(@Nonnull final IItemStack output, @Nonnull final IItemStack input);

// Add a recipe to chop wheat into 2 sticks
mods.cfm.ChoppingBoard.addRecipe(<minecraft:stick>.withAmount(2),<minecraft:wheat>);
// Add a recipe to chop bread into 3 wheat
mods.cfm.ChoppingBoard.addRecipe(<minecraft:wheat>.withAmount(3),<minecraft:bread>);
```
