# 逻辑请求语句

既然你已经明白什么是逻辑门，我可以向你解释在 Reskillable 中允许逻辑门发挥作用的语句。 下一节会有更详细的例子。

在下面的所有语句中， `requirement` 字符串代表任意支持的请求（包括CompatSkills或其它附属添加的请求）。

* * *

## 单一逻辑请求

### “非”请求

The simplest logic requirement that Reskillable supports is the ability to invert a requirement. 它通过一个 **NOT** 门来实现这个请求，语句是 `not|requirement` 。 根据在逻辑门部分的解释，只有在不满足特定的 `requirement` 的条件下，这个“非”逻辑请求才会被满足。

* * *

## 双重逻辑请求

另一种逻辑请求稍显复杂，因为它们需要两个 *input* （输入）请求。 因为这些逻辑门相对简单，所以两个请求的顺序实际上并不重要，但我会用 `requirement<sub>1</sub>` 和 `requirement<sub>2</sub>` 来区分这两个请求。

它们使用相同的语句： `gate|[requirement<sub>1</sub>]~[requirement<sub>2</sub>]</0 > 。 其中 gate 是 <code>and`, `nand`, `or`, `nor`, `xor` 和 `xnor`  
中的一种。 **注意**： `requirement<sub>1</sub>` 和 `requirement<sub>2</sub>` 两边的方括号不能省略。

* * *

### “与”请求

The **AND** requirement unlike the other logic requirements is mainly useful for nested logic requirements (more on this lower down), as locking an item or other object with multiple requirements requires all of the given requirements to be met. This is the same as the **AND** functionality, so should be used when possible, as it will make the tooltip be formatted in an easier to read manner.

## 例子

下面所有的例子都将使用 CompatSkill's CraftTweaker 帮助中的语句以易于阅读。 The logic requirements work just fine from the config as well.

以下所有的示例脚本 CraftTweaker 脚本条目都使用 import （导入包）语句： `import mods.compatskills.Requirement.addRequirement;` 这主要是为了缩短每行的长度，让文本更具可读性。 (So if you are copying any of the examples you will need to include it at the top of your script file.) A couple of the examples below that directly start with `mods.compatskills.` are locks that are specific to CompatSkills and that I came up with decent logic requirement examples for.

* * *

Only allow attacking zombie pigmen outside of the nether: `mods.compatskills.EntityDamageLock.addEntityLock(<entity:minecraft:zombie_pigman>, "not|dim|-1");`

* * *

Allow entering the nether if a player has an attack or defense level of at least 15: `mods.compatskills.DimensionLock.addDimensionLock(-1, "or|[reskillable:attack|15]~[reskillable:defense|15]");`

* * *

Once a player gets to defense level 24 and agility level 24 stop allowing them to use leather armor:

    addRequirement(<minecraft:leather_helmet:*>, "nand|[reskillable:defense|24]~[reskillable:agility|24]");
    addRequirement(<minecraft:leather_chestplate:*>, "nand|[reskillable:defense|24]~[reskillable:agility|24]");
    addRequirement(<minecraft:leather_leggings:*>, "nand|[reskillable:defense|24]~[reskillable:agility|24]");
    addRequirement(<minecraft:leather_boots:*>, "nand|[reskillable:defense|24]~[reskillable:agility|24]");
    

* * *

Only allow using a wooden shovel until the player gets mining or gathering level 5: `addRequirement(<minecraft:wooden_shovel:*>, "nor|[reskillable:mining|5]~[reskillable:gathering|5]");`

* * *

Only allow a player to use ender pearls if they have magic 32 or if they have agility 32. Do not however let them use it if they have both skills at level 32: `addRequirement(<minecraft:ender_pearl>, "xor|[reskillable:magic|32]~[reskillable:agility|32]");`. This can be useful if you want to have multiple progression trees and ensure that they have to follow one if they want to keep being able to use specific items.

* * *

It was hard to come up with an example for **XNOR**, however this is an example of how it can work.

Only allow a player to level defense to level 5 if they have not put any points into attack yet or if they are at attack level 32: `mods.compatskills.SkillLocks.addLevelLock(<skill:reskillable:defense>, 5, "xnor|[reskillable:attack|2]~[reskillable:attack|32]");`

### 嵌套逻辑请求

Nested logic requirements are when you are using a logic requirement as one of the `requirement` parameters in another logic requirement. Pay special attention to bracket placement in nested requirements.

* * *

Only allow diamond ore to be broken if the player has mining level 20 or if the player has both gathering level 25 and mining level 15: `addRequirement(<minecraft:diamond_ore>, "or|[reskillable:mining|20]~[and|[reskillable:gathering|25]~[reskillable:mining|15]]");` *Note*: This also has the side effect of not allowing players to place diamond ore unless they meet the requirement as well.

* * *

Only allow using the elytra with agility 15 in the end or having agility and magic levels 25 while not being in the end: `addRequirement(<minecraft:elytra:*>, "xor|[and|[dim|1]~[reskillable:agility|15]]~[and|[reskillable:agility|25]~[reskillable:magic|25]]");` *Note*: Once you reach agility and magic 25 you are unable to use the elytra in the end. This is in part just as an example and not necessarily what someone wants.

Another way that the above requirement could be written is: `addRequirement(<minecraft:elytra:*>, "reskillable:agility|15", "xor|[dim|1]~[and|[reskillable:agility|25]~[reskillable:magic|25]]");` because both sides require at least agility 15.
