# 与非运算符

A **NAND** gate is an inverted **AND** gate. This is the same as using the output of the **AND** gate as the input to the **NOT** gate. This means that the **NAND** gate returns `TRUE` in all cases except for when both inputs are also `TRUE`.

| 输入1 | 输入2 | 输出 |
| --- | --- | --:|
| 0   | 0   |  1 |
| 0   | 1   |  1 |
| 1   | 0   |  1 |
| 1   | 1   |  0 |

```
空白示例：
nand|[]~[]

填写后举例：
nand|[reskillable:defence|24]~[reskillable:agility|24]
```
