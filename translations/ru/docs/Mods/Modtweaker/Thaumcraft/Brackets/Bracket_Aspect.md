# Aspect Bracket handler

The aspect Bracket Handler allows you to retrieve a Thaumcraft [Aspect Stack](/Mods/Modtweaker/Thaumcraft/Aspects/CTAspectStack/) in case you need one.

Aspects are referenced in the Aspect Bracket handler this way:

    <aspect:name>
    
    <aspect:ignis>
    

If the Aspect is found, this will return an [CTAspectStack](/Mods/Modtweaker/Thaumcraft/Aspects/CTAspectStack/) Object with the stacksize 1.  
Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Mods/Modtweaker/Thaumcraft/Aspects/CTAspectStack/) for further information on what you can do with these.
