# Level-Lock Support

## PSA:

This feature works off cancelling the Level-Up event in Reskillable. Some mods that call the levelUp(); method directly will bypass the locks! This includes mods like Scavenge: Reskillable and TogetherForever!

## Level-Lock Support

Level-Lock Support is a weird feature that came from a joke that Skysom made in a DM one day. This feature is entirely for those sadistic enough to implement it! This gates the progression to the set level not the "going from" that level!

CTSkill = [Skill-Bracket Handler](/Mods/CompatSkills/Supports/Reskillable/BracketHandlers/)

### Syntax:

    // Blank Example:
    mods.compatskills.SkillLocks.addLevelLock(CTSkill skill, int level, String... defaultRequirements);
    
    // Test Example:
    mods.compatskills.SkillLocks.addLevelLock(<skill:reskillable:agility>, 11, "reskillable:gathering", 3, "adv|minecraft:husbandry/plant_seed");
