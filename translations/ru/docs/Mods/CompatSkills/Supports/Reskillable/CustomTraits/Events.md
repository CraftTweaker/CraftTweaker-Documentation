# Events and Traits

## Credits:

Credits goes out to Kindlich for writing most of the Event implementation!

## PSA:

All the Events listed under the Event Tab are partially documented-based of the information I had available to me at the time. If the events has been update to feature mods Setters/Getters/Methods, that information can probably be found under: [Under the IEventManager Page](/Vanilla/Events/IEventManager/)
