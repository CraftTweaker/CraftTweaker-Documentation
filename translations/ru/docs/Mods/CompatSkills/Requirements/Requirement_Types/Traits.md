# Traits:

Traits is a new addition for Reskillable and makes it so you now can lock things behind a required Trait. Traits are similar to Skills in the way that we've moved them over to a Resource Location instead of a name to allow for more robust extendability. The Trait Syntax is as follows:

    Example:
    trait|ResourceLocation
    
    Working Example:
    trait|reskillable:battle_spirit
    

You can find the Traits's ResourceLocations under: [Skills & Traits](/Mods/CompatSkills/Requirements/Skills_Traits/)
