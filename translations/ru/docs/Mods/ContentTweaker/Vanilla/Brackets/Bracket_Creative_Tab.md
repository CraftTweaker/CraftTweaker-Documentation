# Creative Tab Bracket Handler

The Creative Tab Bracket Handler gives you access to the Creative Tabs in the game.

Creative Tabs are referenced in the creative tabs handler this way:

Vanilla

    <creativetab:name>
    
    <creativetab:misc>
    

If the creative tab is found, this will return a [creative tab](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Vanilla/Creatable_Content/Creative_Tab/) Object.
