# Trait Bracket Handler

The Trait Bracket handler's sole purpose is providing you with [Trait Representations](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Trait/).

You use the trait bracket handler like this:

    <ticontrait:identifier>
    
    <ticontrait:cactus>
    

If the Trait is found, this will return an Trait Representation Object. Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Tinkers_Construct/Trait/) for further information on what you can do with these.
