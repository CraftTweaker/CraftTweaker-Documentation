### CT integration methods

All machines integrated with CT support these methods:

```kotlin
XYZ.clear() // will clear the entire recipe registry
XYZ.logKeys() // will output all keys in that registry to CT's log
XYZ.removeRecipe(key: String)) // will remove the recipe with that key from registry
XYZ.addRecipe(...) // adds a new recipe
```

To retrieve the `Tweaker` class for each machine you have to use the static `mods.poweredthingies.Tweaker` class.
