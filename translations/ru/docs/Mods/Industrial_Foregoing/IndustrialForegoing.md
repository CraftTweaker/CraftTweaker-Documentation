### Item Weight

The `ItemWeight` is a number that represents the chance of an item to get selected. For example:

| Item  | Weight | Chance % |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |
| Stone | 99     | 99%      |
| Dirt  | 1      | 1%       |

| Item  | Weight | Chance % |
| ----- | ------ | -------- |
| Stone | 2      | 66%      |
| Dirt  | 1      | 33%      |

ItemChance% = (ItemWeight/TotalWeight)*100
