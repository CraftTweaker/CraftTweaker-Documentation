# Use Loops to make your script look better

## Problem

We all have seen it: Scripts with more than 500 lines where it says 500 times `recipes.remove(item1);recipes.remove(item2),...`  
Not only is this a pain to write, but it is possible that you spend hours debugging a little typo when the only exception you get is `error in recipes.zs: null`

## Solution

My rule of thumb: When writing the exactly same command more than 10 times, with only 1 Parameter changing, I'll use a loop.

So, instead of always typing out the functions, I declare one array containing all items and iterate through that one.

    import crafttweaker.item.IIngredient;
    
    val Array = [
        item1,
        item2,
        item3,
        ...
    ] as IIngredient[];
    
    
    for item in Array{
        recipes.remove(item);
    }
    

## Advantages

- Your script becomes (in my opinion) easier to read
- You know exactly where your script screws up
- Last minute changes are really easy as all you need to do is adding or removing the item from the array.

## Disadvantages

- Only works when there's only a few parameters changing
- You could screw up your script without knowing it, by say, casting the array wrong
- One error in the array makes the whole array fail and nothing will be done at all.
- You might receive cryptic error messages because of the array being created the wrong way.
