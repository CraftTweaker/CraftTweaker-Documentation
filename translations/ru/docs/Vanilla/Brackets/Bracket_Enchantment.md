# Enchantment Bracket Handler

The Enchantment Bracket Handler gives you access to the Enchantment definitions in the game.

They are referenced in the Enchantment handler this way:

    <enchantment:modid:name>
    
    <enchantment:minecraft:protection>
    

If the Enchantment is found, this will return an IEnchantmentDefinition Object. Please refer to the [respective Wiki entry](/Vanilla/Enchantments/IEnchantmentDefinition/) for further information on what you can do with these.
