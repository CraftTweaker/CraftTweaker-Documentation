```zenscript
// <recipetype:create:milling>.addRecipe(String name, MCWeightedItemStack[] output, IIngredient input)
<recipetype:create:milling>.addRecipe("milling_test", [<item:minecraft:diamond>, <item:minecraft:apple> % 45], <item:minecraft:dirt>);
```

#### Remove Recipes

The follow script will remove all Milling recipes that output Limesand.

```zenscript
// <recipetype:create:milling>.removeRecipe(IItemStack output);
