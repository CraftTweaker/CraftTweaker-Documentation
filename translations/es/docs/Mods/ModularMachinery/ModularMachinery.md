# ModularMachinery

A modpack-maker toolset to create custom, massive, unique and complex machines and recipes from scratch with JSON.  
Provides **native** CraftTweaker support, so if something doesn't work but HellFirePVP [here](https://github.com/HellFirePvP/ModularMachinery/issues)

You cannot create Machines from here, but recipes for them. You use the [RecipeBuilder](/Mods/ModularMachinery/Recipes/RecipeBuilder/) to create the initial recipe Object and then the [RecipePrimer's](/Mods/ModularMachinery/Recipes/RecipePrimer/) Methods to add inputs/outputs to the recipe and lastly, to register it.
