### Item Weight

The `ItemWeight` is a number that represents the chance of an item to get selected. For example:

| Objeto | Weight | Chance % |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Piedra | 99     | 99%      |
| Dirt   | 1      | 1%       |

| Objeto | Weight | Chance % |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Piedra | 2      | 66%      |
| Dirt   | 1      | 33%      |

ItemChance% = (ItemWeight/TotalWeight)*100
