# About ZenCode

This is the documentation section that talks about ZenCode, the programming language that CraftTweaker employs to read and interpret scripts. This section aims to appeal to the more experienced coder that aims to dive into the more complex side of the language in order to approach parts of the mod such as Loot Modifiers, Events, ZenClasses or Functions.

This is not to say that the novice scripter has no place here, but keep in mind that the usages of features in this section go further than adding and removing recipes. Due to this, some of the pages in this section have a letter that represents it's difficulty grade. The grade goes from easier (D) to harder (S) features to use. While nothing stops you from jumping at the harder things, some concepts might prove to be slightly harder if you aren't prepared. You shouldn't drive a car if you have no idea how to turn the engine on.
