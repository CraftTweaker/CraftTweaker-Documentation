# PlayerSetSpawn

The PlayerSetSpawn Event is fired whenever a player's spawn location changes.  
It can be canceled to prevent further processing.

## Event Class

You will need to cast the event in the function header as this class:  
`crafttweaker.event.PlayerSetSpawnEvent`  
You can, of course, also [import](/AdvancedFunctions/Import/) the class before and use that name then.

## Event interface extensions

PlayerSetSpawn Events implement the following interfaces and are able to call all of their methods/getters/setters as well:

- [IPlayerEvent](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IPlayerEvent/)
- [IEventCancelable](/Vanilla/Events/Events/IEventCancelable/)

## ZenGetters

The following information can be retrieved from the event:

| ZenGetter  | Return Type                            |
